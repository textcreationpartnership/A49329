            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is a Treatiſe preſented to thy view, wherein through the guidance of Gods grace, and the conduct of his word, is attempted an aſſay to ſet forth the honour of the great Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to make his praiſe glorious. A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign doubtleſs very acceptable to all that are <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians indeed,</hi> who cannot but rejoyce in any thing that may tend to the Exaltation of our dear Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and Glorified Redeemer, who is the <hi>Rock
<pb facs="tcp:42108:6"/>of Ages,</hi> the eternal excellency of his Church, the joy of all Generations. A work it is wherein all the company of Heaven is to be exerciſed unto all eternity. And albeit whatſoever is undertaken by Men or Angels in this kinde will come infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhort of his Merit, yet it is but fit that what any one hath here ſeen of his glory, either in his word or works, he be free in the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. Poſſibly there have been ſundry at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts made already of the like nature, and ſuch, that this may ſeem to ſome at firſt ſight to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous: However <hi>Let not the day of ſmall things be deſpiſed by us:</hi> If ſome new materials, which will endure the ſearching fire of Gods ſpirit be here added to the gold and ſilver which others have before built upon this foundation, there can be no juſt offence taken thereat; Sure I am they will not be diſallowed by the Maſter of the houſe, and therefore ought not to be rejected by thoſe that are employed and ſalaryed by him to be Co-workers with me in the building.</p>
            <p>It was not (God knoweth) any vain ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſelf-ſeeking that did firſt put me, the meaneſt of the Lords Servants, upon this work, which is indeed <hi>Opus Dei,</hi> the work of God; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it any ſuch ſiniſter aim, that makes me
<pb facs="tcp:42108:6"/>ruſh upon the cenſure of the judicious in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement and compleating of it: Onely if Jeſus Chriſt may hereby be magnifyed, and his Church edifyed, I have my deſire, and it ſhall be the Crown of my rejoycing.</p>
            <p>I confeſs notwithſtanding there was an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offered that did firſt induce me to this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and it will not be amiſs here to make a ſhort mention of it. Thus it was, In the heat of the late Schiſme, it fell to my lot to preach a Sermon in the Cathedral Church at <hi>Winton</hi> upon the 26 day of <hi>December;</hi> wherein becauſe I ſaid,<note place="margin">An Dom. <hi>1654</hi>
               </note> I would not judge thoſe people in the liberty of their Conſciences, who did obſerve the Feaſt of our Saviours Nativity to the Lord (though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all I then<note n="*" place="margin">Which is here alſo inſerted in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</note> ſpake ſeverely againſt the prophane abuſe of it) I was accounted a ſuperſtitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and a malignant (ſuch was the diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting terme that was then uſed) and reported far and near, that I had done more hurt by that one Sermon then other Miniſters that were employed in that Lecture could be able to repair again by many. Which reproachful ſlander was ſo great a trouble unto me, though I was then juſtifyed by Perſons of very good quality that were both wiſe and godly, that I was often minded, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb facs="tcp:42108:7"/>by thoſe perſons, and ſundry others that heard of it, to publiſh in print the Sermon that I then preached, to the end the World might ſee how cauſeleſly I was traduced. I did nevertheleſs forbear the ſaid publication, not out of fear of the perſecutions of thoſe evil dayes; for I did my ſelf obſerve that Anniverſary Feſtivity in my own Pariſh, preaching and adminiſtring the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, when very few durſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to do the like. But having begun upon this occaſion to prepare it for the Preſs, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the purſuance of it my Meditations enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to other matter then I at firſt delivered, I ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Calumny wherewith I was aſperſt, as not worthy to be ſo much heeded, and breaking through many difficulties and hinderances, have by degrees extended that very Sermon to this length which is now before you. The greateſt part whereof I have for ſome years kept by me without further additions; but of late I muſt confeſs I was as the Apoſtle (if I may ſo ſay) preſſed in ſpirit to finiſh what had begun, and to publiſh the whole for the ſake of Chriſt and his Churches.</p>
            <p>And now give me leave to premiſe an Apology for ſome things in this Treatiſe, againſt which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb facs="tcp:42108:7"/>there may ſeem to lie ſome exceptions. Firſt, I may poſſibly be adjudged too inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in fixing the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> account, becauſe it doth not clearly appear (as it is commonly conceived) that he was the Authour thereof. Secondly, It may be ſaid that here are ſundry things inſerted which have no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural co-incidency with the principal ſubject that is pretended.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe Exceptions, I know well there hath been ſome doubt made concerning the Authour of this Epiſtle; for it hath been much controverted a long time whether it was <hi>Barnabas</hi> or <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> or Saint <hi>Luke, &amp;c.</hi> But for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> few were inclinable to entitle him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: their reaſon was, The ſtyle and idiom hereof ſeems to vary much from that which the Apoſtle ordinarily uſed in his writing, neither doth he own it himſelf, by ſetting his mark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the front of it, as he doth in all the reſt of his Epiſtles, but chiefly becauſe the Writer of this Epiſtle acknowledgeth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3.</note> that <hi>he had learned the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation from others, which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was confirmed unto us by them that heard it;</hi> Whereas the Apoſtle with very great confidence profeſſeth that he never received if of men, nor was taught
<pb facs="tcp:42108:8"/>it but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt (which laſt exception is indeed the moſt material,<note place="margin">

See <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>15.3.</hi>
               </note>) Hereupon it ſeems that doubts have riſen concerning this matter: And it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceived by ſome that it would ſavour of too much curioſity to reſolve ſuch doubts; For ſo long as we believe the Holy Ghoſt to be the Enditer, what need we perplex our ſelves about the Writer? As When a Prince will vouchſafe to ſend a Letter to any of his Subjects, it would ill become them to be inquiſitive with what pen it was written; rather we ſhould ſay of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, as once it was ſaid of the Book of <hi>Job, Ipſe ſcripſit, qui haec feribenda dictavit, Ipſe ſcripſit, qui &amp; illius operis inſpirator extitit,</hi> He writ theſe things that dictated them unto the Writer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs though it be granted that it may not be of abſolute neceſſity to make too curious inquiry after all thoſe Pen-men and actuaries, whom the Holy Ghoſt employed in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſervice of being the perpetual Regiſters of the great Council of Heaven, yet neither are they to be quite neglected. We rejoyce in the meſſage of good tidings that is brought unto us, yet that hinders not, but that we may make the meſſenger
<pb facs="tcp:42108:8"/>welcome, and if he be miſſing, though his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhould not add to the Authority of the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, yet we would ſeek him out, that we might gladly know him. Here in an Epiſtle ſent unto us from God, and the meſſenger is ſuppoſed to be miſſing: Let now the name of God be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and his will herein revealed be embraced by us (as it is meet) with all acceptation: But if the knowledge of the inſtrument by whom it is handed to us, may any whit conduce to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the removal of prejudices againſt the truth herein revealed, or in the conviction of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (ſuch as were the <hi>Arrians</hi> of old, and the <hi>Socinians</hi> of late) it is not fit that we ſhould balke it, eſpecially when it is hinted unto us by the ſpirit it ſelf in the holy Scriptures. To ſay nothing of the Title prefixed. to the Epiſtle, it being no part of the Canon, neither having been generally uſed by the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt, therefore not argumentative, though it muſt be confeſſed it hath Antiquity to plead for it. To let paſs alſo the Salutation in the cloſe, which as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.17. is <hi>his token in every Epiſtle, ſo he writes</hi> (which might be more material, but that it may be ſaid, Others in imitation of him do uſe the ſame Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb facs="tcp:42108:9"/>too) we have a more ſure word of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, whereunto we ſhould do well to take heed, and that is this. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle of the circumciſion in his ſecond Epiſtle which he writes unto the ſcattered <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who were of his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar charge, though diſperſed into ſundry remote Regions, calling them therefore Strangers in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the places of their abode, far diſtant from their own Country, hath by a ſingular providence of God poſitively teſtified, that his beloved Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul,</hi> and no other, was the Writer hereof. And to this purpoſe he gives us a plain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. Where he ſpeaks of an Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> written unto theſe ſcattered <hi>Hebrews;</hi> which Epiſtle was it ſeems at that time extant, and in high eſtimation among the faithful, and which with other of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles he commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as of equal Authority, being, as he ſaith, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by him according to the Wiſdom given unto him. Now this Epiſtle there mentioned, is very probably the ſame, which in the Scripture goeth under the Name of the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews;</hi> otherwiſe how is the Church the pillar and ground of truth in holding out all the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and whole Counſel of God, if ſhe hath been negligent in ſo eminent a part of her <hi>Depoſitum</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42108:9"/>commended unto her by the Authority of two chief Apoſtles, or, as one ſaith, loſe <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and keep <hi>Peters</hi> that makes mention of it, which is not with any colour of reaſon to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined? We may therefore hereupon conclude that it evidently appears Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was the writer hereof.</p>
            <p>But for that he here altereth his ſtyle, and doth not put his Name unto this, as he doth unto the reſt of his Epiſtles, there are ſundry probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures commonly for it given. Firſt the <hi>Jews</hi> had conceived againſt him a very great prejudice, and leaſt they ſhould thereupon have rejected his writing with indignation, he changeth his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtyle, and omitteth his uſual Introduction of <hi>Paul an Apoſtle,</hi> &amp;c. Not regarding himſelf, ſo that the word of God might run and be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Moreover he was deſign'd to be <hi>Apostolus Gentium,</hi> the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as appears <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.7, 8. Therefore thought it beſt here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale his Name, and to waive his ordinary title, leaſt he ſhould <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> aſſume to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo the Title of <hi>Apostolus Hebraeorum,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which properly belonged to another. And therefore though he might in an extraordinary way be employed by the Holy
<pb facs="tcp:42108:10"/>Ghoſt in writing this Epiſtle to the people of that Nation (as Saint <hi>James</hi> alſo did.) yet withall he is very cautious herein to put them in minde of their duty to their own peculiar Guides that had the rule over them, which we ſee he doth once and again in this 13 Chapter verſ. 7.17.24. But the truth is (as it is ſaid) theſe reaſons are but conjectural, that which is to ſatisfie us in this point is this, even ſo it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And thus I have given a large and clear reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this doubtful matter, which indeed was but fit to be done, becauſe I do here oftentimes ſpeak of the ſaid Apoſtle, as the ſure and certain Authour of that Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas there are ſundry branches of this Treatiſe, which do ſeem to have no affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the ſenſe of the Apoſtle in the Text, and conſequently not to be connatural with the main Doctrine that is here inſiſted upon, I anſwer, Firſt, As Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is (according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles word) <hi>All and in All,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11.</note> That ſea of living waters by whom all ſprings and rivulets of divine truth have their riſe and original, and unto which they muſt return again; ſo is this Text, as it is here interpreted, not onely comprehenſive of the
<pb facs="tcp:42108:10"/>whole myſtery of Chriſt, but alſo of the whole duty of man towards him: And therefore that which is here written in order thereunto ſhould not be accounted as an impertinent digreſſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is no new thing to finde corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and collateral interſertions ſuperadded in a way of ſubſerviency to the principal ſubject hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Tractates either of a Theological or meer Humane Alloy: For it is with Books (as one very well makes the reſemblance) as it is with Trees, theſe have ſome Maſters and chief Branches in which the main Sap of the Root is carried, but they have alſo ſome under-ſpriggs and water-boughs, which by the vegetation of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Shootes do proſper the better, and are made to ſerve both for ornament and fecundity to the whole Body; Thoſe have commonly ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſubject into which their whole ſtrength and ſtream runs, but they have likewiſe ſundry <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerga</hi> of leſs conſequence annexed thereto, which though abſtractedly conſidered may ſeem to be at a wide diſtance, yet being Methodically linked together, have a coaleſcency, imparting each to other both illuſtration and confirmation. So is it here, ſundry reſultancies and inferences do occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally ſpring up in this Book, as there do in all
<pb facs="tcp:42108:11"/>our Sermons that we undertake, when the bloud and juyce of it runs chiefly into the Apoſtles ſenſe of the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> the Doctrine of the Eternity and Immutability of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which giveth life unto all the reſt. So that what the Evangeliſt Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpake of his Goſpel which he wrote the ſame may I ſay of all that is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Book, <hi>Theſe things are written that you might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, and that believing you might have life through his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I hear what is further objected, as, that I multiply Quotations, borrow the help of ſundry Authours, and do but <hi>actum agere,</hi> bring the ſame <hi>crambe</hi> of words, repeating what hath ſufficiently been imparted to the World by others, who have at large, and with much perſpicuity and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity of ſpiritual Wiſdome wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ten of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Now though I have hinted at this before, yet I conceive a neceſſity is laid upon me to rejoyn unto this Charge a full and clear Vindication.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, this I ſay, I know not of any that hath written of this ſubject ſo largely before me; But this I know, that both for the matter and manner of handling it, as it is grounded upon that foundation, which is precedaneous unto it, I am alone without any competitours or pretenders whatſoever.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:42108:11"/>
            <p>Secondly, I do yield that I have in the carrying on of this Work conſulted with Writers both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern; and have thereupon, not without good cauſe been the bolder to offer my conceptions to publick view (though poſſibly in ſome places they may not be well reſented) find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them confirmed by thoſe that have been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily reputed burning and ſhining Lights of the Church in their ſeveral Generations, who have born the burden and heat of the day in the Lords Vineyard, and upon whoſe Labours we are now happily entred. Yea more, I have not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted them, but frequently made uſe of their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, rendring it in their own words, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to put by Imputations of Colluſion, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles for the Conviction of Adverſaries, alwayes to give full ſatisfaction to thoſe who ſhall dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently apply themſelves to a religious peruſal hereof. Nor am I at all aſhamed to acknowledge what I have done in this kinde, nor need I fear to be taxed with any Plagiary ſuperinducements of other mens Labours, though indeed as I have gone thorough my Neighbours Fields (the Owners whereof I do for the moſt part ſignifie by name) I have here and there plucked ſome Eares of Corn, and fitted them for my purpoſe
<pb facs="tcp:42108:12"/>(which by a natural propriety is challenged of all as a common right) yet I have no where put in my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckle, and ſo can plead a juſtification in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Howbeit this I may without arrogancy make my Plea: <hi>viz.</hi> My borrowing, whatſoever it hath been, is fully counter-ballanced with my lending again, which though it be to be reckoned but as a poor Mite caſt into the Lords Treaſury, yet it is <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum menſuram donationis Chriſti, ac moderationem Spiritus dividentis ſingulis prout vult,</hi> and may through Gods bleſſing be to the furtherance of the Goſpel, eſpecially in regard of thoſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Scripture, which I have here given, to which no Expoſitors of Holy Writ, nor any Authours whatſoever could lay any claim, nor any of their Aſſertours can at this day for them: All which I do humbly commend to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Examination, a Liſt whereof I conceive fit here to preſent unto you, though the Table at the latter end of the Book will give directions by Aſterisks to the places where they are to be found.</p>

            <p>The Interpretation of theſe Texts of Scripture
<pb facs="tcp:42108:13"/>(Gentle Reader) as they are rendred in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I do leave unto thy moſt ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Not but that there are beſides theſe, ſundry Expoſitions of other places of Scripture here alſo given that are not uſual, yet nevertheleſs may well be conceived to be according to truth, without condemning thoſe that have been commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Theſe likewiſe you will meet with as you go along in your reading, and will require your moſt ponderous meditations. Onely I do deſire that when you meet with an interpretation of the Holy Scripture which may ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange unto you, not to be haſty in paſſing cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon it, till you have found the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about it to be fully finiſhed.</p>
            <p>Again, it will perhaps be objected unto me by ſome, that I do here take but a ſlight occaſion to be very large and vehement in maintaining the honour of our Church againſt her Adverſaries, by juſtifying the Order which ſhe obſerveth in the Publick Worſhip of God, and Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: Whereto it may well be anſwered, Is there not a cauſe? When not onely the Church which is our Mother, the moſt eminent Pillar and Stay of Divine Truth hath been miſerably rent and torn by Schiſmes and Diviſions, but our Lord
<pb facs="tcp:42108:14"/>Jeſus Chriſt himſelf alſo was very much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured thereby, being made by a ſort of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people the very Authour and Fautor of their Diviſions; as if he had not been, and were not ſtill to be to his poor Church what the Text here inſiſted upon, proclaims him to be, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Same? Cauſe enough then there is for every true Son of the Church to ſpend his Zeal in this Contraſt upon all occaſions, and to marke them as the Apoſtle adviſeth, who cauſe theſe Diviſions and Offences, that they may be avoyded.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſſed, the late Schiſme, while it grew more and more prevalent in this Kingdome till it pleaſed God to reduce us to our priſtine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by a merciful providence never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, did bring us eſpecially of the Miniſtery into ſuch a low deſpondency and puſillanimity of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that we had almoſt loſt that Chriſtian Valour, yea and Engliſh courage <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> for which our Church and Nation have in times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us been ſo much renowned: But ſince the Lord God hath ſpoken, who can but prophecy? when deliverance hath been ſent unto us by the out-ſtretched arm of an Almighty Power, who can forbear to rejoyce in it? And when God hath ſhewed us our Errour, in ſuffering our ſelves to
<pb facs="tcp:42108:14"/>be deluded by a ſpirit of ſeduction, who can but lament his back-ſlidings, and appeare with his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtrength in the vindication of that Truth and Church, which have been ſo treacherouſly forſaken? For my own part I do here in the truth and uprightneſs of my heart ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt before God and men, as I have been aſhamed of my credulity in giving heed for ſome time to the cunning inſinuations of thoſe who pretended they were for the cauſe of God, but were found Lyars, ſo now (though poſſibly it may be ſaid of me, as it was of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10.</note> that my bodyly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is weak, and my ſpeech contemptible, and therefore it is but little that can be expected from me that may be for the advantage of the Church in any kinde (all which I will not deny) yet) I do and muſt account it my duty with that little ſtrength that I have, to endeavour what I can by all wayes and means the undeceiving of thoſe poor ſeduced people, who, being bewitched with the like ſorceries, do yet continue in their perverſeneſs againſt the Lord and againſt his Anointed. What elſe ſhould I do after ſo woful a defection that hath been among us, when, to my apprehenſion, I hear often the word of our Saviour to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſounding in mine eares,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:42108:15"/>confirma fratres,</hi> when thou art converted ſtrengthen thy brethren: Let no man therefore blame me for my forwardneſs and vehemency in this matter upon any occaſion, for I cannot but ſpeak the things which I have ſeen and heard, as the ſame Apoſtle alſo ſaid; yea let my tongue cleave to the roofe of my mouth, and my right hand forget her skill (how poor and ſlender ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be) if my tongue and pen both be not now ready for the Churches ſervice, to fill up the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation at the ſetting on the Head-ſtone of this great Work of Omnipotency in the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Order among us, both in point of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, and of Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with Grace, Grace unto it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I ſhould now alſo be loth to be ſo far miſtaken, as that by giving new experiments of rendring the ſenſe of Scripture otherwiſe then it hath been generally taken, I ſhould thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to favour that upſtart Sect of holders-forth of new Lights, and new Truths, againſt whom I have alwayes proteſted my diſlike with much loathing and abhorrency, and do ſtill account of them no better then the ſmoke that comes out of the bottomleſs pit, which would in time darken the light of the Goſpel, as much as the foggy
<pb facs="tcp:42108:15"/>miſts of Popery ever did, where it prevaileth. Deplorable is their eſtate, and accurſed be their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts whoſoever they are that ſet up any of their pretended Lights in competition with the Holy Scripture, and are not contented with that truth which hath already been revealed to the Church in thoſe things that are neceſſary to ſalvation. <hi>The bed of divine truth is green</hi> all the year long,<note place="margin">

If we therefore (to uſe the Apoſtles words) or an Angel from Heaven ſhould trample upon this bed, or deface the beauty of it by ſcattering in it any other ſeeds, which (of what nature ſoever they be) will prove in effect to be nothing elſe, but the Tares of the Enemy, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> But to uncover this bed, and to ſhew what a delectable variety there is in the ſweet nature of it, to the end that thoſe who take pleaſure in beholding it, may more and more affect it, will I hope be adjudged, by thoſe that have judgment to diſcern, to be no
<pb facs="tcp:42108:16"/>faulty compliancy at all with new fangled Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſts, who pretending to novel diſcoveries of truth, root up the foundation. There is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in Plants many ſecrets of nature that are yet unknown, ſo, in the Scripture much of the minde of God that former Ages hath not been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, which they that come after may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand more perfectly, eſpecially in the ſenſe of thoſe Prophecies which are to have their full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment in the laſt Times. Truth is not now barren, as one obſerveth well, although ſhe was prodigal in teaching our Anceſtours <hi>(Etiam quicunque fuere mortalium ſapientiſsimi, multa ſciſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur, non omnia)</hi> ſhe hath a reſerve laid up in her Cabinet for her friends and followers at this day, and will ever have, till ſhe opens all her treaſures unto them at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>I ſay therefore, as countenance is not to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thoſe Maſters of Novelties and new-Light Mongers of theſe dayes, who frequently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently from the light within them vent moſt damnable Opinions, expreſly contrary to the Written Word (as the Gnoſticks of old did, whoſe Diſciples they are, though they know it not) ſo ſhould encouragement be given to thoſe, who taking along with them the Analogy of Faith, and
<pb facs="tcp:42108:16"/>the Analyſis of thoſe Places of Scripture which they fix their Meditations upon, are ſo happy as to finde out other interpretations thereof then were before known, which may occaſion more light alſo to ſpring up in the Church to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and advancement of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>To which glorious ends that all whatſoever is here written in this following Treatiſe may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily tend, hath been, and ſhall conſtantly be the hearty Prayer of the poor unworthy Authour thereof, who is</p>

            <head>A POSTSCRIPT TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Method that is here uſed is (I confeſs) according to the ordinary mode, plain and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without thoſe Logical curioſities, florid and ſubtle inſinuations, or rhetorical tranſitions and cadencies, Wherein the accurate Writers of theſe Times do abound (which things nevertheleſs in their right uſe and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine appearance, no man that is wiſe will at any time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn) but for their ſakes, whoſe Converſion from Sin, Conviction of Errour, and Corroboration in the Faith, this Treatiſe eſpecially aimeth at, is this order obſerved; Which as it hath not been found altogether unſucceſsful to ſuch ends and purpoſes, ſo may it now alſo, through Gods bleſsing, be ſtill uſeful therein, being ſuted for the moſt part according to their minde and expectation; Wherein I do but follow the Apoſtles Example, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all things to all men, that by all means be might gain ſome: Yet if they ſhould chance to meet with ſome things here Hard to be underſtood (as <hi>even Saint</hi> Pauls
<pb facs="tcp:42108:17"/>
               <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> which required that all things ſhould be done to Edification, had in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Testimony of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> things ſurpaſsing the capacity of the unlearned) it will be eaſy for them to paſs them by, and to ſpend their time and thoughts upon that, which they will finde to be within the ken of their apprehenſion.</p>
            <p>One thing more I muſt premiſe, with which I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Addreſs. In regard I have here preſumed to render the ſenſe of ſome places of Scripture otherwiſe then they have been commonly interpreted least ſhould thereupon be cenſured for affecting too much a Digreſsion from the grave and profound Judgement of others that are or have been before me, it is thought very requiſite to add hereunto a Synopſis of the Names of ſundry Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours both Antient and Modern that have been, as I ſaid before conſulted with in the purſuance of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to whom for the moſt part, as it was meet, I have with due reverence yielded a ready and willing complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in their ſenſe of Scripture, and other their Religious and Orthodox Determinations, which I hope will ſuffice not onely to take off the imputation of a Paradoxal Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, but free me alſo from a charge of offering vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to Sacred Theology, though Philology lead me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into her private Retirements, and put me therein upon new Explorations.</p>

When my Diſcourſe therefore ſhall anſwer your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you will, I hope, afford your diligent attention thereunto.</p>
            <p>The words at firſt ſight ſeem to be the ſudden efflux of the Spirit,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42108:26"/>added here in the cloſe, as the reſult of that which had been ſaid before, and as the Total Sum of the Epiſtle, ſhutting up the whole as in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis; implying that all that was written amounted unto this: <hi>viz Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for-ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or elſe they are inſerted as a reviving Cordial to the poor Hebrews, who might (ſeeing the Gentiles were received into Covenant with God) fear themſelves to be quite caſt off from Grace, becauſe their Nation had ſo generally with much pertinacy refuſed that great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was brought unto them: Upon which account the Apoſtle inferreth this ſhort and ſweet <hi>Epiphonema</hi> to comfort them with now at parting; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the ſams yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> As much as to ſay, Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame to you, as he was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: who, as he was at firſt ſent to ſeek and to ſave the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo now alſo (notwithſtanding former unkindneſſes, and though his grace is not to be confin'd as it hath been, but muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all Nations, yet) he abideth ſtill a Saviour unto you; if you abide in the faith, and he will be ſo likewiſe to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Thus may this Verſe ſeem to carry this ſenſe within its own Verge, not having any intercourſe with the Contexture bordering upon it. But it is generally conceived by Expoſitours, that theſe words are coincident with thoſe immediately before-going, where an Exhortation is given to the Hebrews, to be mindful of their Guides, who had taught them the way of God truly, not according to the Moſaical, but Evangelical Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and to imitate them in the holineſs of their lives, and in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to the faith which they ſealed with their death. The words are theſe:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Remember them which have the rule over you (or are your Guides) who have ſpoken unto you the word of God, whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of their converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The force of example we all know is very great to induce likeneſs of Manners, and the greater the example is, the greater power it hath to draw to ſimilitude. It was wont to be ſaid, <hi>Facile tranſitur ad plures,</hi> We are eaſily moved to go after a Multitude: but it may well be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Facile tranſitur ad majores,</hi> It is no hard matter to make us imitate great Authorities, be the patterns good or bad; for the vices of Rulers are commonly the rule of Vices: and the vertues of Leaders will alſo lead unto Vertue.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it is that the Apoſtle propoſeth unto the Hebrews the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their Leaders, to the end that they might not, as he ſaith, V 9.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42108:26"/>be carried about with divers and ſtrange Doctrines: where they had their inſtruction, there alſo they might receive eſtabliſhment by their imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: in whoſe example, <hi>Quiddam memorabile deſignat Apoſtolus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin;</hi> the Apoſtle noteth ſome memorable matter, worthy of their ſaddeſt thoughts: implying thus much, that their Teachers had in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that Word which they had ſpoken unto them, gone through much affliction, not loving their lives unto death, for that was the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the iſſue and Exit of their Converſation, which the Hebrews ſhould conſider; that when they ſaw how ſtedfaſt and invincible their Leaders were in the faith, their example might the better move them.</p>
            <p>And now to ſet an edge upon this Exhortation, the Apoſtle ſheweth in the words of my Text, that the ground and foundation of their faith to which they did ſo conſtantly adhere, was no novelty, nor yet ſuch as did fail them, or expire with them; but being the rock of Ages was co-equal with the Church from the beginning and would be alſo the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſure foundation for all the faithful to the end of the World: and that is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> Underſtand it thus: It is as if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid, They well knew whom they believed; and you may alſo know him too, if you will do as they did; for Jeſus Chriſt who is the unchangeable God bleſſed for ever, as they made him their ſtrength and their ſupport, ſo he never failed them. Be you therefore followers of them, looking unto Jeſus, who, as he led them into all truth, and preſerved them in it, ſo will he likewiſe do the ſame unto you, and to all others that ſhall come after you who believe in his Name; for he is the ſame <hi>Yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may now glean up by the way ſome Doctrinal concluſions, which ſhall be but named, that ſo we may come without any further protracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to taſte of the ſweetneſs that ſpringeth abundantly from the Fountain of the Text.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. We learn hereby, That people ought to be followers of their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as they follow Chriſt, and no otherwiſe.</item>
               <item>2. The way to abide ſtedfaſt in the faith, is to ſtick to the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, Jeſus Chriſt, who is ſtill the ſame.</item>
               <item>3. Whoſoever they be that make a ſincere profeſſion of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall never be aſhamed of it; for Chriſt will conſtantly without any change, own and maintain that faith which hath once, and but once, been delivered by him to his Saints, being firſt and laſt like himſelf.</item>

               </note>Theſe things premiſed, let us now come to the Text, whereof if I ſhould undertake to ſpeak any thing in order to this time of Solemnity, which yeſterday, to day, and ſome daies following is held up and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued among us, as if it had reference unto it: <hi>I ſhould then indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare myſelf to be but of yeſterday, and to know nothing;</hi> at leaſt, to know nothing of my Text, as I ought to know.

When he had ſpoken much, and there was much more behind, but that time failed him? Rather what ſhould I not ſay? For our Theatre at this time is not only within the narrow bounds of the World, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends beyond it; and our Meditations in handling of this Subject, are to reach from Eternity to Eternity. Let us then duly poize it, and with the good bleſſing of God make uſe of it for our Edification.</p>
            <p>A three-fold interpretation may be given.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt may be ſaid to be, The ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, in reſpect of his Divine Nature.</item>
               <item>Secondly; This may be applied unto him with a reference to the whole Creation.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, It may ſo likewiſe with a more eſpecial reſpect unto his Church and People.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And here, becauſe it may ſeem ſtrange that I ſhould give ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral interpretations of this Text: Give me leave to premiſe an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for my underſtanding herein. I would not be too vehement in forcing a Text to carry a ſenſe, which is not directly, or by warrantable deduction to be found within the compaſs thereof. And it is a great wrong that is done unto Divine Truths, when Scriptures are produced for their foundation that are not Homogenial with them. As for this three-fold interpretation which I have here given of this Text, though the laſt be commonly accounted the moſt proper, as being conſonant to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42108:27"/>the ſcope of the Apoſtle; yet the other two are not to be rejected as inconſiſtent with the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt therein. Nay, is there not a greater latitude then ordinary to be allowed unto it, when it is propounded as a Divine Theorem, cutting aſunder the thread, as it were, of the former Diſcourſe, that the eyes and thoughts of all men that read it, may in a ſingular manner be fixed upon it; as on a general Sentence or Propoſition comprehenſive of more then might alonely have reference to the preceding Verſe? Surely there is ſomewhat extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to be found in it: Therefore as I have already preſcribed my Method; ſo <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>The first Interpretation of the Text.</head>

Having then the concurrency of others that are ſound and Orthodox, whoſe Works praiſe them in the gates: Let us conſider how this Text may repreſent this great Myſtery unto us in the ſeveral parts of it.</p>
               <p>It is a moſt certain truth, that the Divine Generation is that which gives unto the Son of God his perſonal Being; which Generation is acknowledged by all that are ſound in the faith to be from all eternity. This is that which in the Text, if it referreth at all to the eternal perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of Jeſus Chriſt (as it undoubtedly doth, and will be here made to appear) muſt be underſtood by Yeſterday: Jeſus Chriſt is, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42108:28"/>truly rendred, not only for the Day of Chriſt's Reſurrection, but alſo for God's Eternity: ſo may the word <hi>Heri, Yeſterday,</hi> when it is ſpoken of God in this manner, be taken in the ſame ſenſe likewiſe: for the eternal God is not to be conceived by us in any thing that concerns his Eſſence or Relation under any Notion of time properly, as ſome have impiouſly conceived.</p>

               <p>But that it may not at all ſeem ſtrange unto any, that Eternity be ſpoken of with terms appropriated unto Time, we do finde frequent expreſſions of Scripture in a tendency hereunto, and that in this very particular, concerning the eternal Being of the Son of God. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Wiſdom, i. e.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt who is the Wiſdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.) <hi>poſſeſſed me in the Beginning of his Way.</hi>

               <p>We may therefore, I believe, proceed on without any Heſitancy in grounding it upon this Text, which I acknowledge hath not been in this ſenſe commonly underſtood, and therefore have I been the larger in laying the foundation; in regard alſo of the great uſefulneſs of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us in theſe times: I ſhall endeavour to ſpeak the more freely of it.</p>

               <p>This I conceive we may with modeſty aſſert; the firſt Perſon being Father from Eternity, the Son muſt be co-eternal with him, otherwiſe the Relation falleth: And there being nothing in God but Eſſence and Relation; if the Relation be taken away, what the Conſequence would be, is eaſie to judge. But doubtleſs this Divine Relation between the Father and the Son, was from all Eternity; otherwiſe we may argue further: if the firſt Perſon be not Father from Eternity, there muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in time a change in his Perſonal Denomination, which is incompoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible with the Father of Lights, in whom there is no variableneſs.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, Created me, making the Verſe to run thus; <hi>The Lord created me in the beginning of his way.</hi> And thereupon did theſe wretched Hereticks with open mouths moſt impudently proclaim to the World their curſed errour, which was, That Jeſus Chriſt, who is here called Wiſdom, is a creature, and not the eternal begotten Son of God the Father.</p>
               <p>This in ſhort was the riſe of this Cavil, which may eaſily be removed by theſe following Anſwers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Tranſlation of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> though it be of great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and much account in the Church; yet it is not Authentick, not being given by the immediat Inſpiration of God: and therefore too weak a foundation to bear up an Opinion, in a point of faith, which is not warrantable from the word of Truth.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42108:31"/>
               <p>Secondly, It is poſſible that that Greek Tranſlation might be right enough at firſt, but might ſince, either of purpoſe, or caſually, by reaſon of the affinity of words, be depraved: that is, that whereas they had rendred it <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, If it were ſo, or not ſo, is it not a thing much to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that poor worms of the earth ſhould ſo preſumptuouſly deſcant on the Dignity and Prerogative Royal of the Son of God, yea, depoſe him from the Throne of his Glory, upon the account of a ſmall Title on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which it not of any moment whether it be taken one way or other; for the Original word, as it ſeems, had anciently both ſignifications, <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>Poſſeſs</hi> and to <hi>Create.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Some Writers both Ancient and Modern, do give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer hereunto in this manner. The Eternal Generation of the Son of God, is ſometimes called Generation, and ſometimes Creation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo ineffable, that it cannot fully be expreſſed by any one word; for Generation ſignifieth a Production in the ſame ſubſtance, but with a certain mutation in the Begetter: but Creation ſignifieth a Production of another ſubſtance, yet without any mutation of the Creatour. Now the Son of God is ſo produced, as that he receiveth the ſubſtance of the Begetter, and therefore in that reſpect he is ſaid to be Begotten: but he receiveth it without any mutation or alteration of the Begetter, and therefore in that reſpect he may be ſaid to be Created: not that his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity ſhould thereupon be called in queſtion; or that he ſhould be thought to be a Creature: but that from both theſe words, we might receive what was fitting, and reject what ſeemeth to be unfit in the right underſtanding of this unexplicable Myſtery. This Anſwer being perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the matter in hand, I have been willing to inſert, to give full ſatisfaction to thoſe that are <hi>Scepticks</hi> in this point, and for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their faith that are ſound and orthodox.</p>

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Qui paſcun ter ex A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua &amp; ſp. ſancto non ided aquae filios eos recte quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piam dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crit. <hi>Pet. Lom.</hi>
                  </note> If it were ſo, the Holy Ghoſt ſhould by a proper right be called the Father of Chriſt, which he never is in Scripture, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did ever any that truly profeſſed the Chriſtian Faith, acknowledge him in any reſpect to be: for he is not the principle of the ſubſiſtence of the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, and therefore not the cauſe of the Divine eternal Sonſhip; neither was there a new perſon conceived at his unconceivable over-ſhadowing of the Virgin, and therefore he could not be the Father of Chriſt in reſpect of any inferiour filiation: ſo that we muſt ſeek out ſome other ſenſe of the Angels words, then that which theſe Dreamers have fooliſhly imagined.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The words therefore of the Angel may well be conceived to have reference to the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> unto which he ſeems to have reſpect in the 31. Verſe of this firſt of <hi>S. Luke,</hi> the words of the Prophet are theſe;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive, and bare a Son, and ſhall call his name Immanuel:</hi> which <hi>Immanual</hi> is being interpreted, <hi>God with us;</hi> Implying, he ſhall be called both the Son of God, and the Son of man; and though the Angel makes mention only of the firſt of theſe Denominations, V. 35. yet it is not to be taken excluſively of the other, for he ſaid before, V. 31. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus:</hi> whereby he meaneth, that he ſhould be called alſo the Son of man. In a word, the Particle (<hi>Therefore, Luke</hi> 1.35.) wherein the ſtreſs of this Objection li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is not to be referred to the conception of Chriſt by the Holy Ghoſt, as the cauſe of his Sonſhip; but to the Prophecy that went before both of the Mother and the Son, wherein they were both concern'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That that ſhould be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whereas it is ſaid, He ſhall be called the Son of God; it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42108:32"/>is to be underſtood after the manner of the <hi>Hebrews, Pro vere manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabitur,</hi> He ſhall be truly manifeſted and declared to be the Son of God: as where it is ſaid, He ſhall be called <hi>Immanuel;</hi> it is not meant, He ſhall be called by that name, but declared to be ſuch as that name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and acknowledged to be ſo among his people: ſo by theſe words <hi>(He ſhall be called the Son of God)</hi> is meant, he ſhould be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the Son of God, when he was born into the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a Beginning of what he was not, but that then he ſhould begin to be manifeſted and acknowledged what he was.</p>
               <p>Or elſe laſtly, He which was ever the Son of God in reſpect of his Godhead, ſhould now be called the Son of God exiſting in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; or, <hi>God manifested in the fleſh,</hi> as the Apoſtle phraſeth it,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</note> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>

               <p>Thus do theſe <hi>Chriſtomacho,</hi> fighters againſt Chriſt ſhew their teeth, though they cannot bite, and ſhoot out their bolt, wherewith they let fly nothing but their own folly.

                  </label> Firſt, It would be obſerved that Chriſt is not called here <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>The firſt Created,</hi> as it ſhould indeed be rendred, if their ſenſe ſhould paſs for currant; but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is, The firſt begotten of every creature, which ſignifieth that he was begotten <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Before all the Creation,</hi> as appeareth by what is preſently added by the Apoſtle, V. 16. <hi>For by him were all things created;</hi> which clearly diſtinguiſheth him from thoſe things that are made, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him alſo the priority before all things, V. 17. which muſt conclude his Generation to be Eternal.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42108:33"/>
               <p>Secondly, If the Apoſtle muſt be taken in ſuch a ſenſe, as that his words here ſhould make Chriſt and the Creature Correlatives each to other, it will not neceſſarily follow that he from his original was a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture too. And now to make it clear, that the Apoſtles meaning is of a higher aim and ſtrain; I ſhall undertake with all due reverence and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety to ſpeak of this great Myſtery, according as God hath dealt to me the meaſure of faith, and the Lord give us a right underſtanding therein. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems here to be raiſed up by the Holy Ghoſt into a ſpiritual rapture, ſetting forth the Glory of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as I may ſay, in all its Dimenſions, the height, and length, and bredth, and depth thereof: The height, in that he is the uncreated everlaſting Image of the inviſible God (for in that ſenſe it muſt be taken, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he was before the Creation) thereby ſetling him upon the Throne, making him co-eternal with God, and to be of the ſame nature with him, and the firſt begotten of every creature: by which words, he puts the Crown upon his head, giving him the Sovereignty and Dominion over the whole Creation. The length, in that he is before all things, and that by him all things conſiſt. The bredth, in that he is the head of the body the Church, extending his Influences, Wiſdom, Care, and Providence (as the head uſeth) towards all his Members. The depth, in that he became in time the firſt begotten alſo from the Dead; that as he was the Creatour and Lord of all Living, ſo when poor Creatures had by their rebellion againſt him, brought themſelves under the power of Death, even then did he by his dying and triumphant riſing again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Reſtorer and Deliverer alſo, <hi>that ſo in all things,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>he might have the preheminence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then when the Apoſtle is in ſo high an elevation, taken up with ſuch a glorious deſcription of the Lord Jeſus, aſcribing unto him his ſeveral Excellencies, according to his ſeveral Relations, wherein he ſtandeth, to his Father, to his Church, to the whole Creation: is it fit for low-ſpirited men, loaden with lumpiſh thoughts of the creature, to force him to ſtoop unto them, by obtruding a ſenſe upon him, which never entred into his thoughts once to imagine? Yea, which would make him contradict himſelf, as we ſay, in the ſame breath: for to be the uncreated everlaſting Image of the inviſible God, and to be a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in one and the ſame Nature, are <hi>teto Coelo,</hi> directly oppoſite each to other, as the Eaſt is to the Weſt.</p>
               <p>But without controverſie, there is truth in the Apoſtles words, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42108:33"/>no lye at all. Whereas therefore he ſaith of Chriſt, That <hi>he is the Image of the inviſible God, the firſt begotten of every creature.</hi> He makes the latter Clauſe the conſequent of the former, connecting the whole in this manner; The right of Primogeniture is in Chriſt, becauſe he is <hi>the Image of the inviſible God:</hi> and in that regard do all Creatures viſible and inviſible derive their Being from him, ſome having more noble impreſſions of his Image upon them then others, according to their rank and order in the Creation, as it hath been contrived and eſtabliſhed by the wiſdom of the moſt High. For example, ſuch as have life in them by an internal principle of Nature, are in a higher degree of honour by their conformity unto Chriſt, then thoſe Creatures that are without life; for life in whatſoever ſubject it be, whether intell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ectual, rational, ſenſitive, or vegetative, is a Rivolet ſpringing from that divine Fountain that is in Chriſt: amongſt which ſorts of living creatures, there is alſo a gradual Propinquity to the Fountain; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which propinquity, they have all their ſeveral quicknings and vital operations. The Evangeliſt S. <hi>John</hi> intimates ſo much, when he ſaith, <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John <hi>1.4.</hi> Haec vita eſt lux non Brutorum, &amp;c. ad quae il<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> That is, that Chriſt had a ſpecial care and reſpect towards Mankind and that the life which is in him is not ſo gloriouſly manifeſted toward the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures that are inferiour to man.</p>
               <p>And now to ſpeak freely my poor judgment concerning this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture of Jeſus Chriſt by way of inſtance, as it hath reſpect to Angels and Men. Whereas Chriſt is called the firſt born, doth it not imply that he is, <hi>Intellectus Primogenitus,</hi> the firſt begotten Intellect in reference to the Angelical Nature, becoming thereby the firſt Mover thereof, and giving it a Being according to the counſel of his own Will? Doth it not ſignifie alſo that he is, <hi>Ratio Prin ogenita,</hi> the firſt begotten Reaſon in order to the Rational (in which reſpect it may be probable, he is called by the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>. <hi>John</hi> 1.10.14.</note> Which Intellect and Reaſon were indeed originally of the Eſſence of God, derived unto Chriſt by an eternal and unconceivable Generation, the Image whereof was from him devolved upon Angels and Men, though not in that manner as was upon Chriſt himſelf; the Eſſence of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that way incommunicable to any creature: for as he is the firſt begotten of every creature, giving unto every Species his proper por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>According to this ſenſe which I have here given, the Apoſtle is, I conceive, to be underſtood in the fore-cited place of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> to which, I confeſs, I do the more willingly incline, becauſe the Original word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is not only to be rendred <hi>firſt born,</hi> or <hi>firſt begotten;</hi> but by a tranſpoſition only of the Accent, as appears here in the Margine, which is allowable: it doth ſignifie alſo, <hi>The firſt Bringer forth of every creature;</hi>

I grant there are ſome Writers both ancient and modern, who, to avoid this Objection which hath been here alledged, maintain it to be meant of Chriſts Humane Nature: but the truth is, it is not ſo to be underſtood, as it hath been here made to appear, but of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; for Chriſt is not properly the Son of God according to the fleſh, and therefore never in that ſenſe ſaid to be begotten: and yet notwithſtanding the aforeſaid Heretical Cavil over-thrown like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>Thus briefly as I was able (poorly enough, God knoweth, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grace given unto me) have I inſiſted upon this great Myſtery: Let us now improve it for our edification.</p>

               <p>In the Reign of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> there was a Toleration granted to the <hi>Arians,</hi> giving them liberty free from any moleſtation, not prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to argue publickly againſt the Godhead of Chriſt; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they grew thereupon extremely impudent, venting their Blaſphemy to the great diſhonour of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: neither could any man prevail with the Emperour to retract that Toleration, which he had with too much indulgence granted unto them. At length one <hi>Amphilochius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Iconium,</hi> a holy man, not being able to endure the diſhonour that was ſo frequently done unto Jeſus Chriſt, was willing to expoſe himſelf to a great hazard for his ſake. Entring therefore into the Court with ſome other Biſhops, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emperour and his ſon <hi>Arcadius</hi> (whom he lately created Joynt-Emperour) ſtanding together, he did very low obeyſance to the Father, but none at all to the Son: <hi>Theodoſius</hi> imagining the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Reverence towards his Son to proceed rather from ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and ignorance, then from any wilful neglect of the Biſhop, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth him to ſalute his Son alſo as became his Imperial Dignity: <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philochius</hi> anſwered boldly in theſe words, <hi>Satis eſt quod honorem ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi habitiſſet;</hi> It was enough that he had given him that honour which he did: and withal coming up cloſe to the Son, in a familiar manner he ſtroaketh him on the head, ſaying, <hi>Salve mi Fili,</hi> God ſave you my Child. Whereupon the old Emperour being much diſpleaſed, gave commandment that the Biſhop ſhould be puniſhed ſeverely for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency, which being ready to be executed, he having now obtained what he expected, very freely ſpeaketh forth his mind in this manner;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42108:36"/>
                  <hi>Siccine O Imperator tam graviter fers contemptum filii tui? Revocat tibi in mentem quaeſo odiſſe &amp; Deumcos qui honoris aliquid adimerent unigenito Filio ſuo, &amp;c.</hi> Is thy rage, O Emperour, ſo great againſt me, for not regarding thy Son? Remember I beſeech thee, that they are odious unto God, whoſoever they be, that take away from his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son the glory that is due unto him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Emperour upon theſe words bethinking himſelf better, acknowledged his fault to the Biſhop, and asks him forgiveneſs, immediately iſſuing forth an Edict againſt <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> whereby all, whoſoever they were, that were found guilty of that Hereſie were brought to a condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A memorable example, in which we may ſee, how Divine Providence hath in thoſe elder times wrought in the hearts of men a reverend awe of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when poſſibly convictions from the holy Scriptures, through the prevalency of carnal compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancies could not be regarded.</p>
               <p>Which example let it lead the way alſo to our ſecond particular of giving unto Chriſt his due honour, <hi>viz.</hi> By a zealous appearance for him againſt his Enemies, who in theſe our daies lay violent hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Glory: curſed Hereticks, I mean, profeſſing open Hoſtility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord Jeſus, ſeeking by all means they poſſibly can to ſnatch his Crown from off his head, by undermining the very Foundation of his Honour, that is, his Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>And ſurely too many there are of that peſtilent Brood in theſe times of Errour and Vanity: an evil Spirit wanders about, not only in our Nation, but in other parts of the world (pretending to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet doubtleſs an Emiſſary ſent from the Prince of Darkneſs) that beguileth unſtable Souls, by infuſing into them a lower eſteem of Jeſus Chriſt, then hath been commonly held up amongſt the people of God; to the end, that this diminution of his Glory might in time bring on with it an annihilation alſo of his Merit:<note place="margin">Numine ſordidius nihil eſt cum ſidit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It doth therefore highly concern all the faithful people of God to appear in this Quarrel; and notwithſtanding all the gloſſing inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and pretenſions of men willing to be deceived (who as they are themſelves of a lukewarm indifferency in many points of Religion;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42108:37"/>ſo they would perſwade all others to a ſinful ſilence with them) yet doth it, I ſay, behove all that truly love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim and maintain an irreconcilable War with all thoſe, whoſoever they be, that march under the Banner of that evil Spirit againſt him.</p>
               <p>And to afford ſome help herein, let us a little ſound the depths of Satan, to the end, that we may lay open ſome of the ſtratagems of Hell, which have been of late contrived and acted againſt the Lord Chriſt and his Glory.

               <p>As to the firſt of theſe, conſider what a fearful deluſion that is which haunteth ſome perſons, putting them upon this Blaſphemy; that they (poor worms) are as well and as truly God, as Jeſus Chriſt: And why?

What in time would become of Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for Sin, Imputation of Righteouſneſs, the Purity, Dignity, Royalty of the Blood of God?

But enough of this.</p>
               <p>The other Project of Hell which is now on foot againſt Jeſus Chriſt in theſe our daies, is to level him with poor duſt and aſhes, not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a preheminence above the ſons of men; unleſs it be ſuch as hath been deviſed by the Devil, for the more cloſe conveyance of his inveterate malice. I do not ſay, it is an Egg lately hatch'd by that Cockatrice; for it is of an old brood, and did exceedingly infeſt the Church in former times (as hath been ſaid before) but though it was ſmitten through and through with the two-edged Sword of Gods word, yet there are now again ſprung up new Heads of that old mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and malicious <hi>Hydra,</hi> who with the faces of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> dare publickly tell us, that our great Redeemer of whom we make our boaſt, is no other then a meer man.</p>
               <p>I am prone to believe, that ſuch as love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity, do find their hearts ſhivering within them at the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42108:38"/>of this horrid Blaſphemy: but behold yet greater Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
               <p>What an amazement muſt it be to all the Churches of Chriſt, to read or hear that,<note place="margin">In <hi>A. B.</hi> his Expoſition of the 17th Chap. of S. <hi>John.</hi>
                  </note> which I have read of <hi>Socinus?</hi> In the reciting whereof there may be ſome doubt (as one ſaid in another caſe) whether you ſhould be deſired to open, or to ſtop your ears; the ſpeech being ſo horrible, as it is a wonderful patience of God, that the Earth opened not her mouth to ſwallow him up quick: yea, it may ſeem ſtrange that the dumb and dead paper did not ſtand up, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to take that Ink wherewith ſuch an abominable Blaſphemy ſhould be either printed, or written, which is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>viz. This Doctrine of Chriſts Deity is ſo abſurd, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World will one day be aſhamed of it; and that the word Trinity may be in time as much abhorred, as Tranſubſtantiation and the Maſs.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>What? Is he the great Jehovah, Eternal, and Immutable, <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever,</hi> and all this while but a meer man? Could a meer man be able to wade into the vaſt Ocean of the wrath of the Almighty, and not be ſwallowed up everlaſtingly therein? Could he be able to enter into a Plea with Divine Juſtice, and put her to a Non-ſuit? To undertake by his own Righteouſneſs to juſtifie ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Myriads of Saints, and not find to his ſhame, his covering infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too narrow to hide the deformities of ſo great a multitude? To encounter with Death and Hell, and overcome them in their own Den? Surely we muſt needs ſay with him in the Goſpel, <hi>If this man were not of God;</hi> Nay, <hi>If this man were not God, he could do nothing, nothing.</hi> I mean in theſe great, noble, and glorious Atchievements: For, admit that he was perfect in himſelf, both in his birth and in his life; the power of the moſt High, when it came upon the Virgin in her Conception, ſtopping up the Current of original ſin, that it could not pollute him, and his own proper power preſerving him all his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42108:38"/>life-time from the leaſt ſpot of any actual ſin: yet alas, wherein could this ſingle finite Righteouſneſs of his be efficacious towards others, if he had not been God as well as Man? It was his Godhead that did put an infinite worth upon all that he did, and upon all that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made his Righteouſneſs to be of ſo diffuſive a nature, that it was enough to juſtifie all the World: for the obedience of God to the rule of the Law, and the blood of God given up to the ſentence of the Law, are infinitely comprehenſive, far beyond what either men or Angels are able to conceive.</p>
               <p>Had it not been for this, might not Divine Juſtice have juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him as an Offender, yea, as the greateſt of all other? For his undertaking to juſtifie others would have been the greateſt ſin that ever was committed in the World, as being the abſurdeſt mockery, and moſt inſolent affront that ever was offered to the grand Majeſty of God: And would not Death and Hell likewiſe have ſtill kept them in their clutches with triumphant Inſultations trampling upon him, making him to know, that his Arm was too weak to ſubdue their Kingdom, and that it would coſt more to redeem thoſe Souls they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, then ſuch a poor man as he was ever able to compaſs?</p>
               <p>But bleſſed for ever and ever be his Name; as he happily began this noble Enterprize for his poor people: ſo to his eternal honour, and their everlaſting ſalvation, he did victoriouſly, as became the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, prevail therein.</p>
               <p>Now therefore away with that curſed <hi>Anthropolatry</hi> of <hi>Socinians,</hi> let it for ever be trodden under foot as unſavoury Salt, having no reliſh in it acceptable either to God or man. And let the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what hath been here ſaid, provoke all that bear a ſincere affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Lord Jeſus, to cry out and ſay, It is time for the Lord to ariſe, for they have made void thy Glory; thy Crown and Dignity is deſpiſed, thine Honour is laid in the duſt, and what can thy Servants do? Awake, awake therefore, put on ſtrength O Arm of the Lord; awake as in the ancient daies, in the Generations of old, ſmite all thine Enemies in the hinder parts, and put them to a perpetual ſhame, make them to know themſelves to be but men: But make them alſo to know that thou art the Eternal, and the immutable God, yeſterday to day, and the ſame for ever.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the ſecond Branch of this Reſult of the Doctrine of Chriſts eternal Generation.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:42108:39"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Let all the people of God give unto Chriſt that honour which is meet, by a ready hearkning to the Voice of his Word; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting cheerfully to his commands, ſilencing all corrupt Reaſonings that are apt to exalt themſelves in the heart againſt the knowledge of his Will, and captivating every thought to the obedience of his Goſpel: A ſervice this is which is due unto him, becauſe even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the eternal begotten Son of God.</p>

Shortly then, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is he that giveth ſuch a Mouth and Wiſdom unto ſome of his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Servants, that the Wiſdom and Spirit by which they ſpeak is become irreſiſtible:<note place="margin">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42108:39"/>people that heard him, when he taught them it was with authority? But of this more may be ſaid hereafter, when we come to the third Interpretation of the Text, conſidering the Lord Jeſus in his relation to his Church, to which this Subject will be alſo very ſuitable.</p>
               <p>For the preſent, let this word of Exhortation be received upon the account of Chriſt Eternity, as he hath relation to the Father; for in that reſpect he is (as hath been made to appear) <hi>the ſame yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to day, and for ever.</hi> Hearken therefore to his word, becauſe he is eternal.</p>
               <p>And here give me leave to ſtrengthen this Argument with ſome few Corroboratives, that it may effectually bring the conſciences of men under the power thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt then let it be remembred, the Father will have him to be thus honoured, even upon this conſideration of his eternal Relation unto himſelf; as appears by that Voice which came from the excellent Glory, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5.</note> 
                  <hi>hear him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt himſelf upon the ſame terms expects of us the ſame Service; for when he had (<hi>Pro.</hi> 8.) declared his co-eternity with the Father; what is the inference that he makes thereupon, but this, V. 32, 33, 34. <hi>Now therefore hearken unto me O ye children of men, hear inſtruction and be wiſe, and refuſe it not: Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my Gates, waiting at the poſts of my door; for who ſo findeth me, findeth life, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Add hereunto, this Eternity of Chriſt is a clear evidence of his wiſdom and gravity; for if it be true which <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>With the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient is wiſdom, and in length of daies underſtanding.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 12.12.</note> It muſt be alſo moſt true, that with him whoſe years have been before all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is ſurpaſſing wiſdom, and <hi>of his underſtanding there is no number,</hi>

                     <hi>Job</hi> 13.5.</note> when Wiſdom it ſelf is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to put forth her Voice: for if Daies muſt ſpeak, and multitude of years teach wiſdom, who is fitter to teach then he; and of whom

                  </note> even <hi>Eglon</hi> the Heatheniſh King of <hi>Moab,</hi> when he heard <hi>Ehud</hi> tell him, he had a meſſage unto him from God, he roſe up from his ſeat reverendly to attend the Tenour thereof. Jeſus Chriſt therefore being the expreſs Image of the Ancient of Daies, who might much rather then <hi>Paul</hi> have that reverend denomination given him of <hi>Chriſt the Aged</hi> (though not in the vain ſenſe of the <hi>Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites;</hi>

                     <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3.</note> He I ſay, is to have this honour aſcribed unto him above all others, <hi>viz.</hi> To conſult his wiſdom, and humbly to attend to his grave and righteous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. I name no geſture either of riſing or falling down proſtrate before him, though both at times may well become us, according as he is pleaſed to make himſelf known unto us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And indeed a neceſſity lies upon us to hearken to this his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible wiſdom, and to follow it as our only Guide and Conduct in all our waies; how elſe alas ſhall we be able to eſcape the ſnares wherein Satan ſeeks to entangle us from day to day? For our own parts ſuch is our extreme folly, we are apt like children ſtill to be run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into harmes-way, and to be catching at every Toy: and for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans part (ſuch is his profound ſubtlety and indefatigable malice) that he hath laid his Trains for us even in thoſe waies, wherein we may think our ſelves moſt ſecure; and though we may and do ſometimes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42108:40"/>through mercy eſcape them, and otherwhiles by the ſame good hand of God upon us, unwind our ſelves out of them, yet his Budget is never empty, but one project or other he will ſtill produce to draw us to his Lure: So that were it not for the wiſdom of Chriſt, which checks our folly, and goes beyond all the policy of Hell, we ſhould certainly periſh without any remedy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beſides, what improvement can we make of our Talents in our Maſters ſervice, which (we may well think) is expected from us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we liſten after his counſels, and have a reſpect unto his rules, which he hath ſet us? When our minds are perplexed with various thoughts concerning our eternal eſtate, hovering between Hope and Deſpair, not knowing what to do; here then is Wiſdom, whereto if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, we may be throughly reſolved without any fear of deluſion. When Controverſies ariſe in matters of Religion (as this preſent Age is full of them) and we conſult with ſome on the right hand, but they cannot help us; we betake our ſelves to others on the left, but they involve us more and more in diſorder and confuſion: Here is the Oracle that will and muſt put an end to all ſuch differences. And oh that we were ſo wiſe as to ſubmit to his infallible Determinations! But alas, alas, this is the miſery of many people in theſe daies, who are too like unto fooliſh <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> Refuſe the Counſel of the Ancient, and follow after a new Recent upſtart Light, a light that hath grown up with them, which <hi>Solomon,</hi> yea, a wiſer then he, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew; a very <hi>Ignis fatnus</hi> that leads them into fearful Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where nothing is to be expected unleſs this Eternal Wiſdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it but inevitable ruine.</p>
               <p>And now to cloſe up this ſecond Conſideration, let us, I ſay, give unto Chriſt the Glory due unto his Name in the ſeveral Branches thereof, as they have been laid before us; becauſe even becauſe, he is the Eternal Begotten Son of God, <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or if that be not enough, let us conſider we have reaſon thus to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, becauſe he hath highly honoured us, in that he being the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal begotten Son of God, was pleaſed to become the Son of man, advancing our Nature above the Nature of Angels, whereby we who were at firſt made a little lower then they, are now made a great deal higher, they adoring our Nature in the perſonal Union with the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; from whence alſo hath enſued a great alteration in that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42108:41"/>that is betwixt us and them: for before this exaltation of our Nature, they could and did (it is the obſervation of Biſhop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi>) ſuffer a proſtration of men in their preſence.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.16.</note> But now they do in effect acknowledge the caſe is altered, and will no more aſſume to themſelves any ſuch ſuperiority, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10.22.9.</p>
               <p>Neither is this all the honour that Chriſt hath done us, but as he hath raiſed up our Nature to the higheſt elevation above every name that is named; ſo he hath made us by his Spirit partakers alſo of the Divine Nature,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</note> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. And what more is there that can be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? What honour or happineſs can poor Creatures in this world be capable of beyond this which the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath conferred upon us? If the Sun in the Firmament ſhould attract a humane body, and incorporate it into it ſelf, where it ſhould not only live a life Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial, but to have power to tranſmit the Influences of the Sun into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Corporeal Subſtances here upon Earth, it would ſurely make the whole Creation to ſtand amazed and applaud the happineſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that it ſhould be exalted to ſo great a dignity. But behold here a greater wonder in Heaven, a humane body is actually taken up into the Throne of Glory, Crowned with Divine Majeſty and Honour, hypoſtatically united to the Divine Nature; by virtue whereof the Holy Spirit drops down abundantly into the hearts of men, making them all whereſoever it comes like unto God in Wiſdom, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and true Holineſs, and fruitful in all good works. No wonder indeed that the Angels ſtoop down,<note place="margin">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not in reſpect of his per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſonal being, but <hi>quoad eſſentiam abſolutam,</hi> becauſe the Eſsence of the Son is the very ſame that the Eſſence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is.</note> deſiring to look into the Goſpel, when they have ſuch a bleſſed and glorious Pattern of it there before them in the Mount of God. But this, I ſay, is the honour that Chriſt hath done unto us; and therefore ſurely a mighty engagement lies upon us, to give unto him alſo what honour we poſſibly can: he ſought not to dignifie himſelf, or to make himſelf in any reſpect bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he took upon him our Nature, for he was from everlaſting God in the beſt and higheſt degree, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, very God in all the daies of Eternity; ſo high that he could not be higher, ſo great that he could not be greater, ſo good that he could not be better: but for our ſakes he was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, that we poor duſt and aſhes might dwell with him in Glory.</p>
               <p>Aſcribe we therefore unto him the excellency of his Merit, let us be thankful unto him, and ſpeak well of his Name, for his Name indeed is excellent, and his praiſe above Heaven and Earth; his Name alſo
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42108:41"/>is wonderful, therefore to be had in reverence by all them that are round about him; wonderful in his Eſſence yeſterday, to day, and for ever: And having alſo done wondrouſly well for us (as hath been ſaid.) Now then let all the people praiſe him, let all the people praiſe him, by worſhipping him with a divine Adoration, by a zealous appearance for him againſt his Enemies; by a ready hearkning to the Voice of his Word. And thus have we done with this ſecond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of this Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> With a confideration of it in reference to the people of God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Seeing it is ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, in reſpect of his Divine Nature; Then let all the Enemies of this Eternal Son of God, cover their faces with ſhame, who have not only called into queſtion this his Honour, but with the Sophiſtry of Hell in the ſight of all the World, and before the Sun have moſt impiouſly and impudently argued againſt it. Such were <hi>Cerinthus, Ebion, Sabellius, Samoſatenus, Arius, Photinus,</hi> and all thoſe <hi>Alogi</hi> of old; ſuch have been <hi>Servetus, Socinus, Valentinus, Gentilis,</hi> and their followers of late; all of them profeſſed and open Enemies againſt the Godhead of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It hath been already ſaid, that it is a duty incumbent upon all the faithful people of God, zealouſly to vindicate the name and Dignity of the Son of God againſt all his Enemies. But we ſhall now ſee how he himſelf doth marvellouſly appear in his own vindication; for it may well be ſaid of him, as it is in <hi>Job, He is wiſe in heart,</hi>

                     <hi>Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> quietly ſubmitting himſelf to the truth, as it was preached unto him by that good Biſhop: but within a ſhort time after he returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his former Biaſs, endeavouring alſo to perſwade <hi>Baſil</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be an <hi>Arian,</hi> whoſe conſent when he ſaw he could not obtain,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42108:43"/>he commanded an Order to be drawn up for his baniſhment, whereto being about to affix his name, ſuddenly was his Pen in a miraculous manner ſhivered to pieces, yet ſtill perſiſting in his reſolution, he called for another, and a third, to both which happened the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Accident; a fearful horrour at length ſeizing upon him, he was forced againſt his will to retract that baniſhment: His rage ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs encreaſing ſtill more and more againſt the poor Church of Chriſt, upon the account only of Chriſts eternal Godhead, the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hand of God in the end overtook him: for being engaged in a War againſt the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and wounded with an Arrow, he betook himſelf into a poor Shepherds Cottage, which being ſet on fire by the <hi>Gothes,</hi> he there miſerably periſhed.</p>
               <p>The like judgment alſo befel one of his Attendants, who threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a certain holy man called <hi>Aphraates,</hi> for his zeal and faithfulneſs in adviſing the Emperour to forſake his Arianiſm, was in a very ſignal manner purſued by the vengeance of God; for the Emperour wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to go and make ready for him his Bath, whileſt he was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, ſuddenly being ſtricken with madneſs, he leap'd into the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of ſcalding water, and with fearful howlings wofully died, his former Menaces ſo falling deſervedly upon his own Pate.</p>
               <p>In a word, the Perſecution that was in thoſe times only for this Cauſe of Chriſt, raged ſo much through the whole Eaſtern parts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that ſcarce was there any of the Heathens, <hi>Nero, Domitian, Decius,</hi> or others that did or could in their greateſt fury ſhew greater cruelty then the <hi>Arians</hi> did: But the jealous and the righteous God, who hath ſaid, his Glory he would not give unto another, did not then ſuffer with impunity his Glory to be taken from him by ſinful men; for a miraculous hail was ſent from Heaven upon thoſe parts of an extraordinary bigneſs, like ſtones in hardneſs, which deſtroyed multitudes, both of men and Cattel, overthrew Cities, and with a great Famine was <hi>Phrygia</hi> then utterly ruin'd.</p>
               <p>Thus hath the Lord from Heaven with his out-ſtretched arm, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared viſibly in the vindication of his great and glorious Name, and will ſurely do the like again whenſoever it ſhall ſeem good unto him, (for he is the ſame ſtill without any change at all) ſo that the World may ſay, This hath the Lord done, and it is marvellous to behold; verily he is a God that judgeth the Earth.</p>
               <p>And now briefly to make ſome Application of this: There hath

And, oh that <hi>England</hi> would look about her, that this Treaſon againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be not ſound therein; for if this Iniquity ſhould be marked before the Lord, as an indeleble blot upon our Church and State, it would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be the fore-runner of an over-ſpreading Deſolation: The time hath been, not long ſince, when Socinianiſm grew to a very great height among us (not that it was publickly profeſſed, God forbid, we ſhould ever be guilty of ſuch a <hi>Racevian Impudency</hi>) but it had taken ſuch degrees, that he who was moſt skilful to maintain it, and could propoſe doubts moſt Sceptically about the Deity of Chriſt, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for ſin, and Imputation of Righteouſneſs, was amongſt a ſort of unſtable <hi>Athenian</hi> Noveliſts, who were the Ringleaders of the late Sect of Seekers, beſt accounted of for ſubtlety and acuteneſs of Learning; yea, and Books alſo too many were printed and prepared for the Preſs, containing moſt damnable blaſphemy againſt the Son of God, inſomuch that high time it was to put a ſtop to the current of this peſtilent Hereſie: And therefore was there a Canon expreſly ſet forth againſt it in the year 1640. confirmed by the Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But afterwards when a purer. Reformation was cried up, and great pretenſions made to rectifie all things amiſs amongſt us in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way, to the credit and furtherance of the Goſpel then ever had been before; yet even then was there not inſtead of purging the Land of theſe damnable Hereticks, a more favourable indulgence given to ſome wretched Deſperado's of that Crew then was formerly, who in the face of the World both pleaded and printed againſt the Divine Honour and Dignity of the Lord Jeſus? And albeit after too long a deliberation in determining Buſineſſes of that nature (for as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaid in another caſe, ſo may we in this, <hi>In re tam Sanctâ deliberatio non habet locum,</hi> Away with all deliberation in the high and weighty Points of Faith.) Albeit, I ſay, there came forth at length ſome kind of diſowning of ſuch perſons, and their Fry of corrupt Tenets; yet was there not a condign puniſhment inflicted upon them, according to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42108:44"/>their Demerits, that others might hear and ſear, and do no more ſuch wickedneſs. And why? Liberty of Conſcience muſt be given, and a Latitude allowed unto men in points of Religion; for a free People muſt not be beaten into the Faith, but rationally convinced and perſwaded unto it. By this Trick it was that a Politick Intereſt was promoted, and by this Craft did the Devil gain upon the poor Church of Chriſt. But I ask; Doth God command in his Law that the Blaſphemer be ſtoned to death,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.16.</note> and ſhall it be debated now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any puniſhment at all ſhould be laid upon ſuch under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel?

Is not the Authority of the Law giver the ſame under both Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations Old and New? Are not the Conſciences of Chriſtians as well as Jews ſubject to his Sovereign and perpetual Juriſdiction? Shall the clearer Light that we enjoy, lead us to deal more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with ſuch Miſcreants, whoſe whole endeavour and deſign is to obſcure our Light? And becauſe Chriſt hath brought with him more abundant Grace, ſhould we therefore for his ſake ſpare thoſe that are open enemies againſt him, pretending that we muſt expreſs all meekneſs now under the Goſpel?<note place="margin">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42108:44"/>Faith it ſelf ſhould have been eſtabliſhed in the Land, yea or no. And what became of that abominable <hi>Fry,</hi> a Member of that Convention which was unduely called the Parliament, who (as one tells us) had then blown his Blaſphemy about the Nation with his own Bellows: What befell him, I ſay, but only an Ejectment (ſo far as I could learn) out of the houſe, wherein he with others had too long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued? whereas he well deſerved to be caſt out of the Society of all the faithful people of God.</p>

And for us, we have been long talking of Antichriſt, Antichriſt, how he hath grown upon us, and threaten much to root him out, and not to leave a ragg remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But if in the mean time we ſhould ſuffer Anti-Trinitarians, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Scripturiſts, and Socinians (who are Antichriſts to purpoſe) to continue amongſt us, what are we in effect but meer Anticks in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? and our pretended zeal for Reformation will indeed prove nothing elſe but talk.</p>
               <p>But what the Conſequents will be which undoubtedly will follow upon ſuch a perfidious Connivance, let the lamentable miſeries that lately over-ſpread the Country of <hi>Poland</hi> declare unto us.

               <p>And let us and all Chriſtian Kingdoms in this World take warning by them, for aſſuredly God will not be mocked, but will have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with thoſe Nations, who aſſent unto this Doctrine of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Generation of the Son of God, and yet out of a Supine negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or lukewarm indifferency will ſpare to teſtifie their zeal for the ſuppreſſion of thoſe blaſphemous Hereſies that are contrary thereunto.</p>

                     </gap>, that giveſt a Being to this All: Who is like unto thee, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders? Surely thou haſt a mighty Arm, ſtrong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. Let therefore all the Earth fear thy Name,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 33.8.</note> yea, let all the Inhabitants of the World ſtand in awe of thee, and yield their homage unto thee: And whatſoever is excellent in them, let them lay it at thy feet, and ſay, Worthy art thou,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, Since it is ſo, let then the Lord Jeſus Chriſt enjoy that abſolute Sovereignty which he hath (as his Peculiar) over all the Earth, to diſpoſe of it as ſeemeth good unto him: for it is the greateſt right that poſſibly can be in the world imagined, to have a peculiar Title to thoſe things that are of one's own making. Poor Creatures will ſtand much upon their Priviledge herein: Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the ſame lump, when he hath prepared and fitted it for his uſe, to make one Veſſel unto honour, and another to diſhonour? And hath not the Gardener likewiſe liberty, when he hath contrived his Plat, in ſtretching forth his Line, and treading out his Beds and Borders according to his mind, to diſpoſe of them for his delight, planting and tranſplanting, where and when, and as often as he pleaſeth? Is it not lawful for me, ſaid the Maſter of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, to do what I will with mine own? This liberty is juſtifiable even by the Law of Nature. Seeing then that Jeſus Chriſt is the Creatour of all things, and that therefore the Earth is his, and the fulneſs thereof, having received from him both matter and form (which no Creature in the world can contribute to the work of his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42108:50"/>hands) it is but very meet and requiſite that his power ſhould be paramount at all times, in giving of it to whomſoever he will; and that all men of what Rank ſoever, and to what Right ſoever they do pretend, to be Paravale unto him.</p>
                  <p>In vain it is to make a flouriſh, and according to the faſhion of the world, in a proud inſolent manner, to boaſt of our Pedigree and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours, and that ſuch an Eſtate is derived unto me, through the prudence and providence of my wiſe and careful Progenitours, whereby I have a Propriety in it, and therefore to be perpetuated to me and my Poſterity for ever. Alas, alas, theſe words are but wind, empty and fooliſh, only they carry with them an arrogant encroachment upon that ſupreme Right which belongs unto Jeſus Chriſt; as if their preſent poſſeſſion (notwithſtanding their frequent forfeitures by their multiplied diſobediences) did ſettle upon them ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailment, as that it lay not in the power of the Lord of the whole Earth, to make a re-entry whenſoever he pleaſed, and to paſs a new Grant unto others that are not of their Houſe and Linage. But the wind ſhall blow no man to preferment, out of what quarter ſoever it may ariſe: for the Prophet tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.6. <hi>Promotion cometh neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt,</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP II.</hi> How the Text is Applicable to Chriſt in the work of Preſervation.</head>
                  <p>JEſus Chriſt is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the ſame to Day in the work of Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Government of the World, which he was Yeſterday in the work of Creation.</p>
                  <p>For, <hi>Non minor eſt virtus, quam condere, facta tueri,</hi> There is as much need of power and wiſdom to Preſerve, as to Create. What avails it to plant a Garriſon without a Captain to defend it? To Rigg a Ship for the Sea without a Pilot to guide it? To throw Seed into the Ground with an expectation of an encreaſe at Harveſt, unleſs means be uſed to preſerve it from the Incurſions of wild Beaſts, which would utterly deſtroy it? So unleſs the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of that which he hath created, be is not the ſame to Day which he was Yeſterday; his years are expired, that is, his Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs, in order to the Creatures have their period and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. But who is he, and where is he, that dares put this indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity upon the eternal and immutable Jehovah? Will not common experience convince him, that the ſame good hand which created all things hath been ever and ſtill is ſtretched forth in Upholding and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving? Whence is it elſe that amidſt ſuch Variety, there is ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Order ſtill continued? Yea, that in ſuch Contrariety, Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth not break in, to the ruine of all.</p>
                  <p>Much might here be added, to ſhew the conſtancy and immutability of Jeſus Chriſt in governing and preſerving the World: But we ſhall now contract what might be enlarged. The holy Scripture is clear in this matter, aſcribing unto Chriſt the power and ſovereignty in ruling and preſerving the whole Creation. <hi>By him,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17.</note> 
                     <hi>doth all things conſiſt, viſible and inviſible:</hi> And the reaſon as I conceive ſeems to be there annexed in the former words, <hi>viz. He is before all things;</hi> like a Captain in the head of his Army, without whom they would be of no force, but conſume to nothing, like a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis or Foundation in a Building, which as it muſt have a priority in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42108:51"/>time before the Building, ſo being firſt laid, it upholdeth all that is built upon it. To which alſo the Apoſtle alludeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made mention of the Worlds being made by Chriſt, he addeth, <hi>That he upholdeth all things by the word of his power:</hi> that is, his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Word; which word is very emphatical,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</note> implying that in the things themſelves there is no power, no virtue at all for their own preſervation, but that it is his Rule, Order, Wiſdom alone, that keeps the World upright. For as in a Structure, the ſtones and other materials cannot ſubſiſt in the Building by any qualities or inherent virtues of their own, but only by the ſubſiſtence which they have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Foundation; So is it in the World, the ſeveral Creatures that are therein could never of themſelves hold together with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Symmetry, Comelineſs and order, that appeareth amongſt them, but would certainly run headlong to ruine, were it not for the mighty Word of command that ruling Virtue which conſtantly iſſueth out from Jeſus Chriſt, whereby they are upheld and ſuſtained.</p>
                  <p>His mighty Power it is alone that upholdeth the Earth, that ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the Heavens, that ſendeth forth the winds, that raiſeth up the high and great Waves of the Sea, and again ſaith unto them, Peace and be ſtill. Yea, in the very ſmalleſt things is his Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in governing and ordering the World exerciſed, and made known: He it is that maketh the Feather to move,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29, 30.</note> his mighty hand leadeth the Fly in her way; yea more, the ſame force which now ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Leaf, if he had ſent it againſt a Mountain, it would have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it up from the foundations: and the ſame ſtrength that bloweth up the Duſt, if it came againſt the whole Earth, it would ſhake the bottoms of it. For it is not the natural <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher calls it, that is, as ſome interpret it, the continual progreſſive Agitation, or perfect Adeption of the Creatures that makes them run on in their courſe. But it is that Omnipotent Arm that gave a Being to all things, that ordereth and diſpoſeth the motion of them all, as ſeemeth good unto him. And for their parts, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubject unto his commands: When he ſaith, Go, they go, when he ſaith, Come, they come, when he ſaith, Do this, they do it (as cheerfully as ever the <hi>Centurion</hi>'s Servant did what his Maſter appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him) though many times they be put upon Services contrary to their ordinary courſe, and thoſe natural Inſtructions which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Creation; for they are ſenſible of the power of their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42108:52"/>Lord, and in order to his Glory, and their own preſervation, do una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly agree that his Wiſdom muſt not be controlled.</p>

                  <p>We ſhall not proceed any further in the confirmation of a Point ſo clear, only anſwer a Cavil conceived and produced in theſe times through a miſ-underſtanding of the Sovereign power of Chriſt over the Creatures. In which miſtake (ſince he did, as it is manifeſt give a Being to the World, and thereupon had free liberty to order and govern it, as ſeemed good unto him) we ſhall make it appear, they do not only ſtrike at the Mediatory Scepter of the Lord Jeſus, but at his Wiſdom alſo in the management of his natural Dominion. Which being done, we ſhall come to derive ſome inferences from what hath been ſaid concerning this matter for our further edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

Doth he need helps in Government? Or is he (like <hi>Moſes</hi>) not able himſelf to bear all the people alone? Is he not wiſe in heart, and mighty in ſtrength to manage his own power? Doth he govern the whole Hoſte of Heaven by his immediate Scepter, and muſt he have Coadjutours in Office with him to rule over men? Far be it from us to judge ſo meanly of this great Preſerver of Men. Away therefore with Kings, and all the Powers that are upon Earth: Down with Magiſtracy what ever it be, that is of a Humane Conſtitution ſet up in Competition with him; we have no King but Jeſus, for in him we live and move and have our being: To him then alone be Glory for ever, Amen.</p>

                  <p>Had this abſurd Paralogiſm againſt Magiſtracy been vented by the profeſſed enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, it had been no ſtrange thing: but it may well be accounted the firſt-born of wonder and aſtoniſhment, that people pretending to knowledge, piety, zeal, and who are ſaid in ſome meaſure to order their Converſations according to ſuch pretenſions, yet ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be ſo ſtrongly deluded, as to diſclaim the preſent diſpenſation of Chriſts power in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, which is concordant with what is written, and to wait for another which is not clearly revealed; yea, which is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſafety of mankind.</p>

                  <p>True it is, as Mediatour, Chriſt hath this Paramount Authority, and in that regard all Government in the world is ſubordinate unto him.

                     </note> is teſtified both by the written and unwritten word of God, that is, by Scripture and Nature.</p>
                  <p>The holy Scripture doth give abundant witneſs hereunto. Not to multiply places, conſider we that of <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15.16. where Wiſdom, that is, Chriſt uttereth his voice in this manner;<note place="margin">

                     <hi>By me do Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice, by me Princes rule and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth.</hi> From Chriſt then it is, that they have their power, ſo that they may ſay, It is he that hath made us, and not we our ſelves, he, and not others, no, not the people; for it is not in the peoples choice, whether they will have Government or no, no more then it is in their choice, whether they will make uſe of their ordinary food for their preſervation.</p>

And, <hi>there is no power but of God,</hi> V. 1. where we are to know, that to be of God in the Apoſtles ſenſe, muſt not import, as ſome will have it, a meerly permiſſive Counſel or providence, but a divine Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, Authorization and Vocation, otherwiſe the Apoſtle had ſaid no more for Magiſtrates in this Charter, then the Scripture elſewhere ſaith of Plagues, Famines, and other judgments, yea of the ſins of men, which in the firſt and larger ſenſe are ſaid to be of God too, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 25.20.

                  <p>Beſides this teſtimony of Scripture, Nature doth likewiſe witneſs the ſame unto us; For even that alſo is a Teacher ſent of God,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the teachings thereof are not to be ſleighted. Doth not Nature it ſelf teach us, that Government and Order in the world are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God himſelf, being obſerved by the Creatures, without the impoſition of any written Law?

                  <p>But I have gone too far with this admirable Creature, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch is the excellency and ſweetneſs of it, that if a man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to go with it a mile, I cannot ſee how he could chooſe, but he muſt go with it twain. A Digreſſion I confeſs, but I hope no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, unleſs it be in tranſcribing a little of what ſome Authours have written, and poſſibly ſomewhat out of their own experience and obſervation. To return therefore from whence we have digreſſed; if both Scripture and Nature, which I call the written and unwritten Word of God, do ſo clearly dictate unto us, that Government and publick Authority is an Ordinance of Divine Appointment: men had beſt beware how they trample upon it, leaſt they be found fighters againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Yea, we may moreover from hence alſo infer, that that form of Government which is moſt honourable ought to be beſt eſteemed, and chiefly deſired by men to be ſet up over them even upon this account,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42108:55"/>that the Ordinance of God might have its due luſtre, and that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom in the eſtabliſhment thereof, might be the more magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before the Sons of men. Meet it is that God ſhould be honoured with the beſt, as the pureſt Oyl, the fineſt I lower, the fatteſt Cattel, were of old the fitteſt for God. So in like manner is the beſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy. And if the Powers that be, are not only ordained of God, but are his Repreſentatives alſo to the people (as undoubtedly they are) then ſurely that which is the higheſt and moſt honourable is the moſt proper repreſentation of his glorious Majeſty that can be of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the World.</p>
                  <p>The Regal Power is without all queſtion the moſt eminent in the World, yea it is ſo in the account of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf; for when the Lord in the 16 of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> had reckoned up many bleſſings wherewith he had enriched his people (which though they may carry in them a ſpiritual ſenſe, yet they do withal plainly expreſs that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſplendour and dignity which they had among other Nations) at length he brings in that which he judg'd to be the height of their glory in theſe words,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.13.</note> 
                     <hi>And thou didſt proſper into a Kingdom.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that beyond this they could not aſpire, neither had he himſelf ordained for a people upon earth any higher honour.</p>
                  <p>Add unto this that Promiſe which God made unto <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> That there ſhould be Kings of his Race,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.6.</note> which no ſober minded man will deny but that it was intended for him as one of the greateſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſings that he could be capable of.</p>
                  <p>Briefly (to inſiſt upon no more, becauſe this Point hath of late been ſufficiently cleared by others.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Prinn,</hi> &amp;c.</note>) Is not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt called the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, as being his honour to have thoſe that are of the higheſt eſtimation to be Subjects unto him? Which being ſo, it ſhould be the deſire and ambition of all the people in the world to be ruled by thoſe perſons who are entituled to this ſubjective Regality: And when Divine Providence ſhall with a ſtrong hand and a ſtretched-out Arm lead them unto it (as it hath done us here in this Kingdom and the Nations of our Vicinity for many Generations) it will certainly be their ſin, if they ſhould not ſubmit cheerfully unto it, as it was the ſin of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they out of a diffidence of Gods care and protection of them, and out of an Apiſh imitation of other Nations would in an unſeaſonable, prepoſterous, and tumultuous manner be catching at it.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:42108:55"/>
                  <p>And now all this conſidered, how can a people with any ſerenity of Conſcience, profeſs Godlineſs, and yet ſpeak reproachfully of the Kingly Office, yea account it Antichriſtian, as ſome have done, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming open Hoſtility againſt it? Were it indeed Heterogeneous to the Divine Ordinance of Civil Government, or incongruous to the times of the Goſpel, or prejudicial to the intereſt of the Saints, as it is ſaid to be, or an impeachment in the leaſt degree to the Dignity and Prerogative Royal of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, either in reſpect of his Natural or of his Donative Kingdom, ſuch perſons might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon warrantable grounds to proclaim their diſlike in that kind; But it may now appear to all the World, that the clamour which is raiſed againſt Regal Power upon any of theſe before-named accounts, is altogether cauſeleſs and of no moment. It will not be expedient here to examine them ſeverally (for in ſo doing we ſhould make too large a digreſſion) haply we ſhall meet with them <hi>obiter,</hi> in our way, wherein the inadvertency, or to ſay truly, the Seditious frowardneſs rather then the godly zeal of the Authors and Abettors of theſe Complaints, will be made manifeſt unto all men.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I cannot but proteſt againſt that pernicious Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox which hath been vented by a leading Divine, as he was accounted in theſe late times of Errour and Rebellion amongſt us,<note place="margin">J. O.</note> who in a Sermon preached at S. <hi>Margarets Weſtminſter,</hi> and afterwards Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſaith thus; The Lord had of old erected a Kingly Government in the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> not for any eminency in the Government it ſelf, or for the Civil Advantage of that people, but that it might be a Type of the Spiritual Dominion of the Meſſiah, and ſo was a part of their Paedagogy and Bondage as was the reſidue of their Types every one of them; and conſequently this form of Government not to be of any uſe in the time of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Were this true, we then who are now of the Church of God, as that people were before us, acknowledging this Meſſiah to be come according to the Promiſe, may indeed have juſt cauſe to ſay of that kind of Government, as the Apoſtle doth of Circumciſion, If we ſhould allow of it, Chriſt ſhall profit us nothing, the ſubſtance being come, what ſhould the ſhadow of a King do unto us? But I hope that thoſe who have through the ſubtlety of Satan been miſled into this Opinion, will hereafter find cauſe to retract it, when they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the rule of the Goſpel (to which they pretend an exact
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42108:56"/>Conformity) requires them to pray, and to give thanks for Kings, which as the Apoſtle ſaith, is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3.</note> 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 2.1, 2, 3.

                  <p>If any ſhall deſire to ſee this General branched out into particulars, they may take notice of a fourfold good that under Chriſt accrueth unto men by Government, <hi>viz.</hi> Natural, Moral, Civil, Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>Natural; Is it not good to have our Lives, and the Lives of our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities preſerved and ſecured againſt the rage and fury of unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men, whoſe feet are ſwift to ſhed bloud, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.16? This is the fruit of Government.</p>
                  <p>Moral; Is it not good to have Wickedneſs ſuppreſſed, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs encouraged and advanced? For <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) <hi>exalteth a Nation, but ſin is the ſhame of any people.</hi>

                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.34</note> This alſo is the fruit of Government.</p>
                  <p>Civil; Is it not good that Laws and Ordinances be eſtabliſhed? (for where no Law is (to invert the Apoſtles word) there will be all kind of Tranſgreſſion) Laws, I ſay, by virtue whereof men may ſit quietly and ſafely under their Vines and Figg-trees, and enjoy the good of all their labours, live peaceably together,<note place="margin">

This again is the fruit of Government.</p>
                  <p>Spiritual; It is very good doubtleſs that true Religion ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper and flouriſh in a Nation, that the Ordinances of Divine Worſhip be ſet up in their purity; for this is the glory of a people. But what alas would become of this Glory, were it not for Government? Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority maintains Piety, Government preſerves Chriſtianity: And
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42108:58"/>therefore may we ſay, that the fifth Commandment which eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Authority in the world, is very well placed in the midſt of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue, to be, as it were, a Guard to all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>It was well noted by one,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Nath.

Chriſt hath done the like in the Goſpel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. But when Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity failed, theſe Orderings failed. In the time of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the people were made Prieſts, ſuch as were not of the Sons of <hi>Levi;</hi> who ever would might be Conſecrated: And hath not ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience proved this to be too true in the Churches of Chriſt too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in latter times? It fails Theorically, In the times of thoſe lamented Kings, when there came ſuch overturnings one upon the neck of another,<note place="margin">

So in the time of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> the Law gathered ſo much corrupt droſs and falſe gloſſes, that Chriſt takes much pain to refine it. It fails Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, In the time of the Judges when Authority declined, Piety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,<note place="margin">

                  <p>So then we ſee what good doth ariſe by Government in a way of ſubſerviency to Jeſus Chriſt.

And if it be ſo good, as it hath been made to appear, it muſt needs be very bad to profeſs enmity againſt it, or to take it away: But taken away it ſhall not be, notwithſtanding the vain ſurmiſes of men of corrupt minds; for it follows in the third place which comes now to be conſidered.<note place="margin">3. <hi>Branch.</hi>

                  <p>An Aſſertion that may be maintained againſt the World, if the World ſhould be ſo mad as to hold the contrary: and indeed a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity there is to appear in the maintenance of it.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe a ſort of Antimagiſtratical Spirits have been conjured up in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42108:58"/>theſe times, who, under a pretence of ſetting the Lord Ieſus Chriſt in his Throne, would bring in Anarchy and confuſion, deſtroy all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Government among men, and as their Song is, Overturn, Overturn, Overturn. Inconſiderate perſons that weigh not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of their miſguided zeal, how much diſſervice they do unto Ieſus Chriſt, and how much they gratifie that Antichriſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom yet they wil not ſpare to proclaim an irreconcilable fiend.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That inſtead of honouring the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World under his immediate Government, they do a very great Diſſervice unto him, is manifeſt in that they would veſt him with a power which is inconſiſtent with his preſent Oeconomy, and which he in that reſpect as he is Mediatour, utterly diſclaimed, When he ſaid, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World;</hi> If any ſhall reply, It is true, it was not then, but it ſhall be before the end commeth.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 18.36.</note> The words of our Text will riſe up with full ſtrength, contradicting this Reply, <hi>viz.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt is the ſame Yeſterday, to Day, and for ever.

                  <p>I deny not but the Divine power may act more vigorouſly in the hearts of thoſe that are in Authority towards the end, then it hath done formerly: But that there ſhould be any immediate Act thereof continued without a humane ſubſerviency ſince he hath in wiſdom or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained this as a Mean to exerciſe his Sovereign power amongſt the children of men, is not to be granted. And if Chriſt were to have ſuch a Dominion, as theſe fooliſh people imagine, it will, I hope, be agreed upon, that it muſt be for the carrying on of the ſame Intereſt, which he hath already undertaken, otherwiſe he would not be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, The ſame. And what that Intereſt is, is apparant, <hi>viz.</hi> The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of his Peoples happineſs, and the ſubduing of his Enemies; both theſe in a way of Subordination to his Fathers Glory, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them to be obtained in the exerciſe of ſuch a Dominion, as is by theſe aſcribed unto him. As for his people, their deſire is, or at leaſt ought to be, that they might follow his example, as he already led them the way without intangling themſelves (more then needs muſt) in the things of this World, which would rather be a hinderance unto them then a furtherance. They are not, nor will not be taken
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42108:59"/>up with the muddy vanities of this preſent life; all their minds are upon home, and their Fathers houſe is that which they long after, and for the preſent, the happineſs which they court and deſire here, is to find the Kingdom of Chriſt more enlarged within them, and the ſpreading of the Goſpel more and more in the Nations, which are things that they prefer before any outward glory by many degrees; But how theſe may be furthered by ſuch a Monarchical Government, the holy Scripture ſheweth not. Neither are his Enemies to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued thereby. That Almighty power which ſhall bring them down, is not ſo ſtreightned, but that they may be made to lick the duſt, though the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be the ſame that he is for the preſent even to the end of the world. He that hath done wondrous works in the Land of <hi>Ham,</hi> and fearful things by the Red Sea, that could ſend his Angel, who in one night could deſtroy in the Camp of the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> a hundred fourſcore and five thouſand men, can eaſe himſelf ſtill of his Adverſaries, and avenge himſelf upon his Enemies as ſeemeth good unto him. <hi>The Lord ſaid</hi> unto him, as he is in his preſent Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rule thou in the midſt of thine enemies.</hi>

Add unto this his Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatourſhip, he muſt not relinquiſh (with reverence be it ſpoken) till he hath finiſhed his whole work, that is, brought the righteous God and poor man together again, who were ſet at a diſtance through the Interpoſition of the Devil. In order whereunto he did aſſume the Humane Nature, and in his own perſon joyn it to the Divine, that ſo by virtue of this Union, and in the execution of that Office, which was annexed unto it, he might (<hi>Malgrè</hi> all the malice of Hell) bring many Sons unto glory. But now to lay down this Office by leaving the holy place, where he is once entred, before he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Atonement, which will not be till all the Elect be delivered out of the reach of Satan, would be ſo great a diſhonour to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, that it could not well be repaired by Wiſdom it ſelf. Perhaps it will be ſaid, theſe are great words; be it ſo, but they are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42108:59"/>alſo moſt true: And therefore that diſſervice that is done unto Chriſt by theſe Fifth Monarchy-men (as they are called) in aſcribing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ſuch a power, as they have fancied (for it is but the corrupt fruit of their own Imagination, as will appear in the end) muſt needs be very great likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>That they do promote the Deſign of Antichriſt is alſo clear, though they perceive it not; For hath it not been the Maſterpiece of <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſetting up of the Popes Vicegerency under Chriſt, to make all the Powers of the Earth ſtoop unto him, yea, to render them in time alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uſeleſs, ſave in what he ſhall <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> dictate unto them? It was ſaid of him by one, who knew well what ſpirit he would be of, <hi>That he oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God. or is worſhipped.</hi> So that to deſpiſe Dominion,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4</note> and to ſpeak evil of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, much more to overturn Order and Civil Government, which in infinite Wiſdom and goodneſs hath been eſtabliſhed by God in the World, muſt needs be an acceptable Service done unto Antichriſt, as very much conducing to the carrying on of his pernicious Deſign, and it will ſooner be preparatory thereunto, then any whit to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Chriſt's honour.</p>
                  <p>But to let this paſs; If the word of Truth, the Will of the faithful God revealed in holy Scripture, be conſtant and perpetual, then may we ſafely ſay, That this preſent way which is now in being, of the diſpenſation of Divine Power and Providence in the government of Mankind, ſhall never be changed The Apoſtle adviſeth that every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers, enforcing it with a Reaſon that muſt ever prevail upon the Conſciences of men; for, ſaith he, <hi>the Powers that be are ordained of God, Rom.</hi> 13.1. He exhorteth alſo that Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1.</note> be made for Kings, and for all that are in Authority;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3.</note> adding alſo ſuch a Reaſon that will undoubtedly over-rule the hearts of thoſe that fear God, for ſaith he, <hi>This is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour.</hi> Again, <hi>Put them in mind,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Titus, to be ſubject to Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Powers, to obey Magiſtrates, &amp;c.</hi> Implying, that though they would be apt to forget (mans nature being, ever ſince it was depraved by our firſt Parents Ambition, wondrouſly inclinable to an irregular exorbitancy) yet they ſhould know this was their duty, as well as any other that was given them in charge, by the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>And now I appeal unto all that are not willing to be deceived,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42108:60"/>whether all this doth not clearly imply the perpetuation of theſe Powers; for if they ſhould not continue unto the end, this word of command and exhortation would be altogether uſeleſs and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, which is an Imputation not to be put upon the words of the Wiſe, yea of Wiſdom it ſelf. If any ſhall ſay, yea, there ſhall be a Government to the end, but not of a Humane Conſtitution; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>S. Peter</hi> will preſently ſtop the mouth of this Objection with that expreſs word of command which he giveth, ſaying, <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>whether it be to the King as Supreme, or unto Governours, as unto them that are ſent by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this then being the undoubted Verity which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by his Apoſtles and Servants hath made known unto his Church, and which whoſoever will peremptorily deny, let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Conviction with a manifeſtation of Gods diſpleaſure, what is it that will be objected hereunto? What? Rather then fail, the holy Scripture ſhall be forced to furniſh men with Evaſions, and Truth ſhall be ſet in oppoſition againſt in ſelf. But, O man, who art thou that makeſt this jangling between the words of Truth? That turneſt the Rule of the Righteous God into crookedneſs and deformity? Is it meet to ſay to the Eternity of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Thou art not the ſame? Fie upon ſuch Blaſphemy! Let God be true, and every man a Liar: His words are not Yea and Nay, but Yea and Amen, pure words as ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tried in a Furnace of earth, without any the leaſt droſs of falſhood or prevarication, purified ſeven times: It muſt ſurely therefore be ſome ſtrong deluſion that puts men upon this Satanical Sophiſtry to make Truth contradict it ſelf. And what is it that is alledged, but ſome obſcure Prophetick places of Scripture, the Interpretation whereof will be better known by a patient waiting for the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment (if they be not already fulfilled) then by a raſh and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty determination, to the diſhonouring of the holy Spirit in the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidating of other places that are plain and clear without any ſhadow of Ambiguity whatſoever. And let theſe Fifth Monarchy-men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves judge, whether it would not be ſafer, and become them better to ſubmit to the expreſs Commands of the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture, then tenaciouſly to lean to their own underſtandings in giving a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory ſenſe of ſome dark and dubious Prophecies to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting of thoſe Commands.</p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:42108:60"/>
                  <p>But to cloſe up this whole matter, I ſuppoſe that now after all the pretended challenges that have in theſe times been made by parties to promote the Magiſtrates Intereſt; it will begin to appear unto all men (who are willing to ſee) whoſe Principles are and have been notwithſtanding all their flattering Pretenſions, Antimagiſtratical.</p>
                  <p>Having thus removed the before-named Objection that lay in our way, and made manifeſt the truth of that Propoſition, which tended to the clearing and illuſtrating of our Solution of that Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That Government is an Ordinance of Divine Authorization, made to be ſubſervient unto Chriſt in his great work of Preſervation, and for that end to be continued ſo long as the World endures. Let us now come to make uſe of this Doctrine concerning the Immutability of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in order to the preſervation of his Creatures.</p>
                  <p>A Doctrine it is that is profitable for Conviction, for Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Inſtruction; For conviction of many ſinful practiſes too frequently appearing in theſe times, to the great diſhonour of Chriſt, and his Government over the World; and for the encouragement and inſtruction of all the faithful people of God, who deſire to walk worthy of that preſervation which they enjoy under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, this plainly layeth open the groſs blindneſs that hath come upon many, who notwithſtanding think they ſee clearly. When men will freely acknowledge this great Jehovah, the Lord of all, to be the ſole Fountain of Being unto all Creatures both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth, And yet in the ſeveral changes and revolutions that come upon the World, have their thoughts fixed upon ſecond Cauſes, or ſuch it may be, as they have framed to themſelves, not at all regarding the work of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, as if he were now no more then a mean Spectatour, and had nothing to do in the various Tranſactions of his Creatures about him.</p>
                  <p>How impiouſly do ſome after the manner of the Heathen aſcribe unto Fortune that good or ill ſucceſs which attends upon their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings? It was my good fortune, ſaith one,<note place="margin">Si fortuna volet, fies de Rhetore Conful ſi volet haec eadem, fies de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſule Rhetor</note> that brought me to this Honour, to this Eſtate, wherein now I am; It was my hard hap, ſaith another, that I met with ſuch a croſs, and that I am fallen into this miſery, even as the Poet once ſaid;</p>

                  <p>This you'l ſay, is not as becometh Chriſtians, but behold yet more Abominations; ſome there are, yea too many, who when they go about a matter of any great Import, either to free themſelves from ſome ſad diſaſter, as they call it, or to enterprize a Deſign, which they conceive may be for their advantage, will uſually like unto Heathens, (for the Scripture notes it as a part of their Infidelity) conſult with Aſtrologers (a ſort of people who if they will keep themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own Sphere, would have the Approbation of all that are wiſe; but being excentrick, they are the very Peſt of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth) and when the ſucceſs appeareth, their Stars, forſooth, muſt be Idoliz'd, as the cauſe of that which doth befal them. And how unworthy alas is this of that Faith which we do profeſs? But behold yet greater Abominations.</p>
                  <p>It is an Abomination ſouc'd in the very dregs of Heatheniſm, when people will in time of any loſs, danger or diſtreſs of what kind ſoever it be, not look up to him who is and alwaies was the great Preſerver of men, and upholdeth all things by the Word of his Power; but conſult with Witches and Conjurers for a ſupply and preſervation.

Look upon the Sorcerers of <hi>Egypt</hi> for the one, they cryed in the ſmalleſt Plague that was ſent, and paſt their cunning to remove, this is the finger of God; their power is limited therefore: Look upon the Martyrings of <hi>Job</hi> for the other, for though the Circuit of Satan be very large, even to the compaſſing of the whole earth to and fro, yet he hath his daies aſſigned him, to ſtand before the preſence of God, for the renewing of his Commiſſion; And beſides <hi>Oviculam unam auferre non potuit,</hi> He could not take one poor ſheep from <hi>Job,</hi> till the Lord had given him leave, ſaying, Put forth thine hand: Nor enter into the Herd of Swine (<hi>Matt.</hi> 8.) without Chriſt's permiſſion. To conclude therefore with the ſame learned Writer; Whether Men or Devils be miniſterial Workers in theſe Actions, all cometh from him who is the Judge of all, as from the higher Supreme Cauſe, whoſe Judgments executed, thereby no man can either fully compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, or reprehend juſtly.

                  <p>Away therefore with theſe Abominations, let them not be once named amongſt us, as becometh Saints; That they ſhould indeed be found among the Heathen, it is no marvel: But alas, alas, that ſuch as make their boaſt of Jeſus Chriſt, and are ready alwaies by a verbal profeſſion, to aſcribe unto him the Governance of the World, ſhould be thus beſotted, ſo impiouſly by their practice to derogate from him, and that under ſo clear and glorious a Light as now ſhineth! What Tongue or Pen can expreſs it without a bitter Lamentation?</p>
                  <p>Again, are not the great Repinings and Murmurings which are to this very day found amongſt factious Separatiſts againſt the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and reiterated Diſpenſations of Heaven in the Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Civil Government, according to the ancient Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Realm, a great diſhonour unto Jeſus Chriſt?

Princes of the earth we know do uſually love to maintain their unlimitedneſs and Prerogative which is due unto them, and do not like it that any ſhould make a Scrutiny into the ſecret of their Sovereignty: How much more ſhould poor duſt and aſhes beware of prying into, or deſcanting upon the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of Heaven?

                  <p>Here therefore give me leave a little to treat with theſe diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted people: Do ye well to be angry? And will you be angry ſtill? Will you draw out your anger to all Generations? Surely it will be folly and ſhame unto you, for <hi>Anger reſteth in the boſom of fools,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ec.</hi> 7.9.</note> ſaith <hi>Solomon:</hi> And what alas are you angry for? Is it (as it is to be ſeared it is) becauſe you are croſt in the promoting of ſuch a temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which you had contrived, which yet, according to your own principles, is not of an abſolute concernment to the Kingdom of God? Or whom are you angry with? Is it the perſons of men that have been inſtrumental in bringing to paſs this great Alteration that is come upon us? A ſmall matter it ſeems will make you angry: and as vain and fruitleſs will the ſucceſs of your anger be unto you.</p>
                  <p>There was, as it hath been obſerved, a certain people in <hi>Affrick,</hi> who being troubled with the North-wind driving heaps of Sand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their fields and dwelling places, they gathered an Army of men to fight againſt it, but with ſo ill ſucceſs, that themſelves were alſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried under Hills of ſands. <hi>Xerxes</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a loſs by the rage of <hi>Helleſpontus,</hi> himſelf more mad then the Sea, cauſed Fetters and Manicles to be caſt into the waters thereof, as if he would make it his priſoner, and binde it with links of Iron at his pleaſure: <hi>Darius</hi> did the like upon the River <hi>Gynde,</hi> when it had drowned him a white Horſe, he threatned the River to divide it into ſo many ſtreams, and ſo to weaken the ſtrength of it, that a woman great with child ſhould go over it dry-ſhod. It is not unlike (as the ſaid Authour makes the Compariſon) to the folly of our daies; ſome people muſt not be croſs'd, but will fall to murmuring and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: But as God asketh <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> Whom haſt thou railed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? or whom haſt thou blaſphemed? So may theſe be asked, Whom are ye angry with? who hath diſpleaſed you? Are you angry with the Saw, or with him that lifteth it? What is <hi>Aaron</hi> that you mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at him? And for a concluſion hereof, conſider well that place of the Prophet, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 40.22. <hi>&amp;c,</hi>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42108:63"/>the earth, and the Inhabitants thereof are as Graſhoppers, That ſtretched out the Heavens as a Curtain, and ſpreadeth them out as a Tent to dwell in, That bringeth the Princes to nothing</hi> (much more Uſurpers) <hi>he maketh the Judges of the earth as vanity</hi> (who ſaith, and who ſhall contradict him?) <hi>Yea, they ſhall not be planted, yea, they ſhall not be ſowen, yea their ſtock ſhall not take root in the earth, he ſhall alſo blow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and they ſhall wither away, and the whirlwind ſhall take them away as ſtubble.</hi>

                     <hi>Lift not up your horn on high, ſpeak not with a ſtiff neck, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion cometh neither from the Eaſt nor from the Weſt, nor from the Deſart; but God is the Judge, he putteth down, and ſetteth up another.</hi> And ſay not any more, how comes it to paſs that God hath brought this turn upon us, that our Mountain which was made ſo ſtrong, and from which we thought never to be removed, is now utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, that deſtruction cometh upon deſtruction? Where is that Providence that ruleth all things? For you do not enquire wiſely concerning theſe matters: Stand ſtill rather, and ſee the Salvation of God; Surely Deſtructions are come to a perpetual end, their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ſhall be periſhed with them. For why? Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame ſtill in guiding, governing, and preſerving the whole Creation, and will ſo continue unto the end.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe before-mentioned, there are ſundry others alſo who diſclaim Chriſt's Sovereignty over them; Such are the Covetous, the Ambitious, the Proud, the Worldly wiſe and carnal Politician: What ſubjection do all theſe yield unto this great Preſerver of men?

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28.</note> yet they will not be ſubject unto him, the God in whoſe hand their breath is, and whoſe are all their waies,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.23.</note> they will not glorifie.</p>
                  <p>The covetous Earth worm grovels upon his Dunghil, ſaying to his Wedge of Gold, Thou art my confidence, and as Riches encreaſe, ſo is his Soul more and more proſtituted to his Mammon,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job</hi> 31.24. <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.22.</note> never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that it is the bleſſing of the Lord that maketh rich; nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof, and that he giveth it to whomſoever he will.</p>
                  <p>Doth the ambitious man that hunts greedily after honour acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Chriſt's abſolute Sovereignty, when he will not content himſelf
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42108:63"/>with that Station wherein Divine Providence hath put him; but breaks over all bounds, Civil, Natural, Spiritual, aſpiring ſtill higher and higher beyond his proportion of ſtrength and ballaſt of wiſdom, for the management of his acquired Intereſt, which undoubtedly will either involve him in a Snare to his eternal perdition, or elſe precipitate him here into many woful miſeries?</p>
                  <p>As for the proud and vain-glorious man who exalts himſelf like the Phariſee, proclaiming his Merits to the World,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11, 12.</note> and brow-beating others with overly looks of contempt and diſdain; he (I ſay) not cloſely and ſliely diſclaimeth Chriſt's Sovereignty, but above all others is moſt guilty of an impudent and arrogant encroachment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Prerogative Royal,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 138.6.</note> and accordingly doth the Lord look upon him afar off, in his due time giving a check to his folly, making him to know his diſtance, and that wherein he deals proudly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ex.</hi> 18 11.</note> he will be above him.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the profane Politician alſo that hath been trained up in the Schole of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> and is become a profeſt and perfect Diſciple of his great Patriarch <hi>Achitophel,</hi> is very buſie in his contrivances, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his unrighteous projects with much confidence and ſecurity, as if Providence it ſelf were blinde, and that he who formed the Eye could not ſee, and he that teacheth man Knowledge were altogether ignorant.</p>
                  <p>And thus do poor Creatures make bold with the Lord of the whole Earth, withdrawing from him their ſubjection, though they could not one moment ſubſiſt without him. But O what a ſad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will ſuch preſumptuous wretches make at the great Day, when they ſhall come to ſtand before the Tribunal of this great Lord of Heaven and Earth! They ſhall then finde that their preſervation here hath been but a reſervation, they flouriſh and proſper awhile, but it is that they may be cut off for ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In that Jeſus Chriſt abideth continually the Governour and Preſerver of the World, here is matter of Inſtruction to be learned; which Inſtruction ſhall be branched out into Three Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:42108:64"/>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a Leſſon and inducement to draw poor Creatures to a conſtant dependance upon Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It may let all ſorts of people ſee their own nothingneſs in reſpect of a Spiritual ſtanding in Grace and Holineſs.</p>

                  <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe, we may for our comfort know, that Death was none of thoſe Creatures that received a being from this Prince of the Creation,<note place="margin">

                  <p>And here may poor Creatures ſtand amazed to behold this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Duel, a Duel of ſo great Import, that the Victory which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends

Never ſurely was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency ſo trodden under foot, Never did that Region of Darkneſs and that Valley of Death receive ſuch a Booty, nor ſwallow down ſo precious a Morſel before. O how did the Devil now applaud him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in that he hath ſo notably brought to paſs his Maſterpiece of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt the God of Heaven?

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42108:66"/>(as he ſaith) <hi>God hath ſpoken it by the mouth of all his Prophets ſince the world began:</hi> As much as to ſay, God is very conſtant in the Aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Doctrine, and if God hath ſpoken it, and ſpoken it ſo unmovably without Retractation, firſt by his Prophets, his holy Prophets, yea all his holy Prophets ſince the World began, and again aſſerted, ratified it by his Apoſtles, what ever men do deem of it, it will be found to be a Truth, built upon a ſure Foundation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to be ſhy in the profeſſion thereof.</p>
                  <p>That well known place of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. runneth with a full ſtrength in a tendency hereunto; <hi>The Creature,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the bondage of Corruption, into the glorious liberty of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi> That is, as our Reverend Biſhop <hi>Reynolds</hi> renders the ſenſe, Upon the Creatures ſhall be conferred a Glory, which ſhall be in the proportion of their Natures a ſutable Advancement unto them, as the glory of the Children ſhall be unto them. And of this Advancement the Apoſtle in the ſame place ſaith, The Creature is in hope and expectation; which hope and expectation Chriſt will not ſuffer to be fruſtrated, he being the beginning of the Creation of God, and therefore <hi>(co nomine)</hi> in point of his own honour ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged unto it, as not to ſleight the fervent deſire thereof, in any thing that may really tend to its well-being.</p>
                  <p>But before we proceed any further, it will not be out of our way a little to take into conſideration, according to our poor meaſure, that obſcure and intricate Scripture in its whole latitude, that we may ſee from thence, what juſt cauſe we have to extoll and magnifie the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in this, as well as in any thing elſe that hath been ſpoken in order to the Creatures. The words are theſe;</p>

                     <hi>For the earneſt expectation of the Creature waiteth for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sons of God, for the Creature was made ſubject to vanity,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Four things are eſpecially to be taken notice of in theſe words, upon the diſcuſſion whereof we may (through Grace) come to diſcern ſomewhat of the Minde of the Spirit of God therein. And they are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Creature is ſubject unto Vanity, and under the bondage of Corruption.</p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:42108:67"/>
                  <p>Secondly, The Creature waiteth and groaneth to be delivered from this Vanity and Bondage.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The time of its Deliverance is, when the Sons of God are manifeſted.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The manner of the Deliverance, It ſhall be into the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Liberty of the Children of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Creature is ſubject to Vanity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Creature? What's that? Much Controverſie there is amongſt Writers, who this Creature ſhould be. But it is not my purpoſe to enter into the many tortuous and oblique Maeanders of that Debate, as to tell you what ſome conceive of the Angels in order hereunto, Nor what others ſay of men indefinitely, Others of the Godly only, Others of the Gentile World in oppoſition to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For in ſo doing, I ſhould but lead you into doubtful Diſputations which the Holy Ghoſt forbiddeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. and perplex the preſent Doctrine with more difficulty and obſcurity. Better it is to lay down the ſenſe plainly, which I humbly conceive, and that is this.</p>
                  <p>By the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which is here rendred Creature, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards V. 22. tranſlated the Creation, is to be underſtood <hi>Mundi Machina,</hi> the whole Frame, Engine, and Fabrick of the World, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting both of Celeſtial and Elementary Regions, not troubling our ſelves with any inquiry after thoſe Creatures that have their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Elementary part, Whether they ſhall be intereſſed in that glorious Deliverance that is to come, or no, though they be ſubject unto Vanity, and under the bondage of Corruption, as the place of their Habitation is. And this, I believe, will be the ſaſeſt way for us to take in this Difficulty, wherein alſo we ſhall not leave the Apoſtle, who is our Guide and Conduct in this Labyrinth, but have his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currency with us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Creature,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is ſubject unto Vanity,</hi> under the Bondage of Corruption: This Creature ſo beautiful, ſo excellent, as hath been before deſcribed, in the forming whereof the Omnipotent God hath ſhewn forth his Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, is now ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under a miſerable Thraldom; and that which aggravates the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, is, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhould be brought into this woful plight, by one who was taken out of its own Bowels, and advanced to the Rule and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all the reſt of her Off-ſpring round about him; whoſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42108:67"/>folly as it began this miſchief, ſo it is ſtill laying on more and more load, inſomuch that unleſs the great and wiſe Creatour interpoſe his powerful Arm by removing this Tyrant, or altering his Nature, that Work, whereby he ſought for ever to Glorifie will in time come to nothing.</p>
                  <p>But let us more particularly obſerve the great Miſery that this poor Creature is involved in.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It hath loſt a great part of that Beauty and Goodneſs which the Creatour put upon it in the Beginning, it being by the ſin of man much dulled and diſabled to Act and Communicate its Virtues, as it did at the firſt Creation. And though Nature doth not (according to the Vulgar Opinion) meerly through the length of time, as ſhe groweth in years, fall into decay; yet it cannot be denied, but the Primitive vigour of the Creature is much impaired, and that ſhe hath loſt much of that Comelineſs which was upon her before the Curſe came forth from God for Mans Diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a neceſſity lies upon the Creature to do Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto the Enemies of the Creatour: The Sun muſt ſhine not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Good, but alſo upon the Evil; and the Rain muſt fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Juſt, and on the Unjuſt. The Influences of Heaven make fruitful the Field of the Wicked, as well as the Field of the moſt Righteous man in the World; the Earth giveth out of her fulneſs to one as to another, and is forced to receive into her Bowels the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, as well as the Godly. And this a ſore Bondage unto it, that makes it to be ſtill groaning till the time comes, wherein it ſhall vomit up again the Carkaſſes of the Reprobate, as a Morſel that it could not well digeſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whereas the Creature is ſtill proclaiming the Glory of God, being unto Mankinde (as it is obſerved) God's Leiger-book,<note place="margin">By Dr. <hi>Henry K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     </note> wherein his marvellous Acts are fairly written, every Species a Line in that Book, and every peculiar Work a Character for Man to read his Maker. And when the curioſity of the Stile, and variety of the Story therein contained, might in reaſon invite all eyes to run it over, to the end, that the inviſible things of God, even his eternal Power and Godhead might be clearly ſeen by the things that are made, when the Creature, I ſay, is thus induſtrious in her kinde to teach man the knowledge of God, muſt it not needs be a vexation unto her to ſee him ſo ſtupid and indocible that he will not learn?</p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:42108:68"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is a miſery to the Creature that there is through the ſin of man ſuch a prepoſterous inverting of that Order which the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour hath in his wiſdom eſtabliſhed, and ſuch a <hi>Hyſteren Proteron</hi> to be found in the Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> That he whom ſhe gloried in at firſt to be her Lord and Governour, in regard of thoſe excellent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities that were in him for that end, ſhould now ſo far degenerate as to be in many reſpects inferiour to brute Beaſts. For very clear it is, that divers Beaſts ſurpaſs man in many Virtues, as the Dove in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, the Ant and the Bee in diligence and induſtry, the Stork in humanity, the Dog in love and fidelity, the Lamb in meekneſs, the Lion in magnanimity, the Serpent in wiſdom, the Oxe and the Aſs in a thankful acknowledgment of benefits, and all of them in ſobriety and contentment: But which is worſe, as touching Vice, therein Man ſurpaſſeth all Beaſts, being more treacherous and cruel then a Wolf, craftier then a Fox, prouder then a Peacock, more voluptuous and unthankful then a Hog, and more dangerous then a Viper: Yea, to fill up the meaſure of his Evils, thoſe peſtilent and noxious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which are alone and particularly in divers Beaſts, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found to be altogether Concatenated (or at leaſt a great part of them) in one man; for there are many men courteous, proud, cruel, envious, unthankful, and Oppreſſours all at one time. And this is a ſore Evil with which the poor Creature is much grieved, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beholding her Darling who was ſo Divinely qualified in his firſt Inſtalment for that Dominion which was granted unto him, to be now eccentrick from his Honour, deſtitute of Underſtanding, and to be a Companion, yea to be inferiour to the Beaſts that periſh.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Add unto this that which is indeed an Addition to the former Miſery, and a great aggravation of it; This Creature ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in her firſt appearance, ſo induſtrions and indefatigable in promoting the Glory of her Creatour, ſo tenderly affectionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mankinde, as hath been ſaid, yet is put to a moſt vile Drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, being made (though unwillingly) the Inſtrument of Man's ſin, which is in truth, the moſt ſordid kinde of ſlavery, that it could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be expoſed unto. Yea, it is never at reſt being continually made to dance Attendance after a hard Maſter: for there is not any ſin that can by man be likely produc'd into Act, but the Creature muſt in ſome reſpect or other be ſerviceable thereunto.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ</hi> 19 5.</note> 
                     <hi>The Sun</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>rejoyceth like a Giant to run his Race:</hi> But alas what a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42108:68"/>check is it unto his joy, when he is taken up every hour by the way to be a Guard and Convoy unto ſinful men in the purſuance of their ungodly Luſts? The Earth in like manner lieth under this Servitude, for though we hear often of her Childrens Tripudiations and Exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the little Hills rejoycing on every ſide, and the Valleys when they ſtand thick with Corn, that they do laugh and ſing; yet ſure we are, ſhe is not without her Trepidations neither, and that becauſe of man's ſin, wherein ſhe is alſo involved whether ſhe will or no. It was once ſpoken by <hi>Nabal</hi> in a churliſh manner againſt good <hi>David,</hi> but the Earth may ſpeak it out of a juſt Indignation againſt a ſort of riotous Unthrifts, whom it foſters every day, Shall I take my Bread and my Water and my Fleſh, and give it to ſuch a Crew? Alas poor Creature it is indeed ſore againſt thy will, to pour out Drink to fill the Drunkard, to provide Meat to cram the Glutton, to expoſe thy Territories to the boundleſs deſires of the Ambitious, to empty thy ſelf to yield choice of Pleaſures to the Voluptuous: But what reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? If wretched man will Lord it imperiouſly, and make thy Service more and more inſupportable, through his ſin and folly, who can help it? It is an Affliction that is not to be avoided, impoſed upon thy ſhoulders by the juſt hand of the Almighty God, becauſe of thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity with him who conſented to the Devil in a plain Rebellion againſt the Majeſty of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And thus we ſee ſome particulars of the Creatures miſery, though more might be added, and what Vanity and Bondage it is made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto.</p>
                  <p>Secondy, This Creature notwithſtanding is in hope to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore waiteth and groaneth and travelleth in pain till the time of her Deliverance cometh.</p>
                  <p>In which words our Apoſtle uſeth a certain Figure called <hi>Proſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popaeia,</hi> whereby humane Actions and Affections are aſcribed unto that Creature to whom they do improperly belong. Which figure we finde often made uſe of by the Prophets, when they bring in the Flouds clapping their hands, the Hills skipping, the Mountains leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Heavens ſpeaking, the Land mourning <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not that any ſhould from thence inferr that theſe Creatures have either an Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Voice to utter, or hands or feet to act really that which is ſo Rhetorically predicated of them: But that poor man may be affected with the Elegancy of the Spirit of God in Scripture, and obſerve the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42108:69"/>excellency of that Nature which moveth conſtantly in the Creature to the praiſe and glory of the Creatour. So the Apoſtle here writes of the Creature as of a humane perſon, hoping and expecting and groaning, not as if there were any of theſe Deſires and Groans audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expreſſed to the ſenſe and apprehenſion of man, but only to ſhew that natural Propenſity that is in the Creature to be freed from thoſe evils that lie upon it. For as it is ſaid of a Servant, that if he may be made free he ſhould chooſe it rather, ſo doth the Creature alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature thereof,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21</note> manifeſt ſuch a kinde of Option, becauſe indeed it can take no pleaſure in that Miſery and Bondage as hath been before preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>The words of the Apoſtle, whereby the Creatures deſire of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is expreſſed, are very emphatical; Firſt, he makes mention of the expectation of the Creature, and that not a naked careleſs ſupine Oſcitancy, but a vehement, greedy, longing, earneſt waiting and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out. The Original word here <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, being as <hi>Pererius</hi> calls it, <hi>Verbum Seſquipedale,</hi> a word of an extraordinary Size; It is a double Compound word, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">

And if there were not ſome eagerneſs in the Creatures expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, the Apoſtle would have made uſe of another word, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, the earneſt expectation of the Creature waiteth (ſaith the Apoſtle) which words joyn'd together carry in them a Pleonaſm, ſaith <hi>Paraus,</hi> adding the more weight, making the expectation the fuller of deſire. Furthermore, it groaneth and travelleth in pain, V. 22. In which words is a Metaphor, taken, as it ſhould ſeem, from Women with Childe, expreſſing the exceeding ſorrow and earneſt deſire to be delivered.</p>
                  <p>And now we may with others from hence collect, ſeeing the Holy
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42108:69"/>Ghoſt uſeth in this Scripture ſo many and ſuch ſignificant words, we may be bold to ſay, that he doth it not in vain; but rather that he would give us thereby to underſtand that though the Creature wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not, nor hopeth as we do, yet that there is in it ſome certain ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire to look for its Reſtauration. If any man think this ſtrange, let him conſider the nature of the Loadſtone, we ſee by experience that if we touch with the ſame ſtone the Pin or point of a Dial or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and ſet the Needle or Compaſs upon it, it will not reſt till it cauſe it to ſtand directly North and South; And this is generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all places of the known or habitable World, whether a man be upon the Sea or upon the Land, if on this ſide the Line, it will forcibly point towards the North, if on the other, towards the South, becauſe the Iron hath contracted the nature of the Loadſtone unto it, wherewith it was touched, and yet hath not the ſaid ſtone any reaſon, neither the Point of a Dial or Compaſs any ſenſe: Now then if this be true (as it is paſt all contradiction) that the Needle or Compaſs through the virtue of the Loadſtone, is by a certain affection and ſympathy ſo carried, that it ſlayeth not till it hath attained that Reſt which Nature hath appointed it, Shall we think it ſtrange that the Creature here mentioned, though void of Reaſon (having yet a greater Inſtinct given it from God) ſhould be carried forward to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire its own Reſtitution, as the Holy Ghoſt affirmeth in this place?</p>
                  <p>The third thing to be conſidered is the time of its Deliverance, <hi>viz.</hi> When the Sons of God are manifeſted, that is, as I humbly conceive, (and let others that have their Conceptions free, give me therefore leave alſo to conceive) When the holy Angels ſhall appear in their Glory at the laſt Day: For they are ſo called in Scripture by way of excellency, <hi>The Sons of God,</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, Their Nature ſhall be made manifeſt to the World; for though they have appeared often under ſeveral Forms, ſometimes in the ſhape of Men, ſometimes like unto flaming fire, for the comfort of the Godly, and terrour of the Wicked; yet doth it not clearly appear thereby what they are: Spirits indeed they are, Glorious and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Immortal Spirits, created after the Image of God, of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Agility, excellent in Strength, able to do Wonderouſly, beyond the power of all other Creatures in the World: Yet this and all elſe that we know of them doth not argue, but that there will be a more perfect knowledge of them at the time of their Manifeſtation; then ſhall it appear plainly what Relation they ſtand in unto God, how they come to have cognizance of things done upon the Earth, how they have been preſent in the Aſſemblies of the Saints, and aſſiſtant unto them in the ſolemn duties of Divine Worſhip and Service;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10.</note> then ſhall it be known and manifeſted how and wherein they have been a Guard to the people of God, to keep them in all their waies; and to conclude, then ſhall they more freely and familiarly converſe with men, not keeping themſelves at a diſtance, as he did, who reproved <hi>Maneah,</hi>

Well may it therefore be called, the Manifeſtation of the Sons of God, when there ſhall be ſuch a general Appearance of them, The Lord among them as in the Holy Place,<note place="margin">

                  <p>And thus have I given my ſenſe of this Particular alſo (which I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the examination of the Church) it being I confeſs ſomewhat ſingular, the Place being taken generally (ſo far as the narrow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of my poor Reading doth reach) for the manifeſtation of the believing Saints, of whom indeed the Evangeliſt ſpeaketh after the

                  </p>
                  <p>But, I hope, I may without offence give in my poor Judgment as I have done concerning this Scripture, conſidering, it is not inconſiſtent at all with the ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt therein, and being guided hereto by ſome certain Probabilities:
<list>
                        <item>Firſt, They are Angels we know, and a great multitude of them, who did at the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt proclaim Peace to the Creature, as well as Good-will towards men; the Creature therefore may be in expectation of the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Angels, that this Promiſe or Salutation given by them might be made good and perfected.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, It is not without ſome reaſon that the Holy Ghoſt doth uſe the different terms of Sons and Children in this Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, Children in the 29 Verſe, eſpecially conſidering that that which is predicated of each, carrieth with it alſo a great difference too; for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God anſwers the expectation of the Creature: But the Deliverance of the Creature is not there to be terminated, but only by the liberty of the Children of God.</item>
                     </list> Now there ſeemeth to me to be ſome probability that the varying of the terms ſhould imply alſo in this place a varying of perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> The firſt to be underſtood of the Angels of God, and the latter of the Saints, the latter word alſo being comprehenſive of the firſt, and not the firſt, in a true propriety of ſpeech, of the latter, conſidering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all what hath been before ſaid, that the Creature muſt have the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels employed in working their Deliverance, but not the Saints. Sons being alſo fitter then Children in the bringing to paſs ſo great a Work, as delivering the Creature out of Bondage is like to be.</p>
                  <p>More might be added, but this ſhall ſuffice for the third Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> The time of ſatisfying the Creatures expectation, that is, at the manifeſtation of the Sons of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That which is next offered to our View, is the manner of the Deliverance of the Creature, or to what it ſhall be reduced at the expiration of its Bondage, it ſhall be delivered into the Glorious Liberty of the Children of God.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:42108:72"/>
                  <p>For it is but ſubjected ſaith the Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in hope, or under hope of a happy change to a better Eſtate; and though this hope deferred maketh the poor Creature to faint, yet the patient abiding thereof ſhall not periſh for ever, For hope maketh not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, eſpecially when it is fixed upon ſuch a ſure Foundation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5.</note> as Gods Eternal Purpoſe which cannot be diſanulled. A Deliverance therefore ſhall undoubtedly ariſe unto the Creature, even as there ſhall be to the Children of God; for as in this corrupt eſtate, wherein they are involved for the preſent by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> they are both together fellow-ſufferers: ſo ſhall they together in their ſeveral Capacities be ſet at liberty, and have their Priſtine Excellencies reſtored, yea, much more enlarged unto them by Jeſus Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Beginning and the End of the Creation, the ſame yeſterday,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.5, 6.</note> to day, and for ever, is of power ſufficient to make all things new.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed upon the Childrens account that the Creature ſhall be Intereſſed in that glorious Deliverance, for as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another caſe, <hi>Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> So may we ſay, doth God ſo reſpect the Creature, that is, the frame of Nature, that he will vouchſafe for its own ſake to beautifie it when it is deformed? Or, doth he altogether for our ſakes that are his Children? For our ſakes no doubt ſhall this glorious Work be accompliſhed, that even the Creature it ſelf alſo may in a free and liberal manner (which is ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired by it) be ſubſervient unto his Glory. And thus we finde the Prepoſition here <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is tranſlated <hi>into,</hi> is taken by ſome as carrying the force of another, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>Propter,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>for,</hi> ſo reading the word thus, The Creature ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Bondage of Corruption for the Glorious Liberty of the Children of God, that is, That the Childrens Liberty might by their ſervice be the more Glorious. For as God made the Creature in the beginning for Man, and becauſe of him ſubjected it likewiſe unto Vanity, that ſo it might not even in the daies of Vanity be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to him for whom it was created: So will he deliver it again for Man's ſake, that is, for the Accumulation and Illuſtration of his childrens Glory; Though I confeſs upon the Creature alſo it ſelf (as it is ſaid before) ſhall be conferred a Glory, which ſhall be in the proportion of its Nature a ſutable Advancement unto it, as the glory of the children ſhall be unto them.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:42108:72"/>
                  <p>And this I conceive in ſhort to be the ſenſe of the Apoſtle as to this Particular, whereby we may ſee clearly that there ſhall be a Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Creature, that is, as ſaith S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Now Heavens and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs.</hi> Which words of new Heavens and new Earth, as they are uſed in a certain place by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> being ſpiritually underſtood,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſ.</hi> 65.17.</note> are I confeſs appliable to the ſtate of the Church in the times of the Goſpel, under the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, when it ſhould be ſo renewed, that it ſhould ſeem to be, as 'twere a new World, old things being done away,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17</note> Types and ſhadows removed, yea, the whole Service of the former Tabernacle aboliſhed, and all things made new, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. So that in this ſenſe this Prophecy is already fulfilled. Nevertheleſs though the words of the Prophet may be ſo taken, yet we are not to confine the Spirit of God thereunto, eſpecially when he hath declared his meaning elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be of a larger extent, as he hath done in this very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; for the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the forecited place, Commenting upon the Prophet, ſpeaks of the new Heavens and the new Earth, as not ſo much to be ſeen in this World, as in that which is to come, his whole Scope in the ſaid Chapter tending thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Let then the ſpiritual ſenſe be acknowledged by us, yet that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but that the other ſenſe (<hi>viz.</hi> That there ſhall really be new Heavens and a new Earth at the laſt Day) may be acknowledged alſo; even as Glory is ſaid to be begun here in thoſe Graces that are ſhed abroad by the Holy Ghoſt in the hearts of the Elect, which ſhall notwithſtanding ſhine forth in its full Splendour in the Kingdom of Glory.</p>

For firſt the Quinteſſence of the Heavens is not combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible by any Elementary fire (if the Apoſtles ſenſe ſhould be taken with a reference to any ſuch kinde of fire) it being a moſt certain Maxime, <hi>Coelum à ſubcoeleſtibus nihil patitur,</hi> that is, Heaven cannot fall under the power of any thing that is below it ſelf; for being next unto the Angels, the prime Agent in Nature, it cannot poſſibly be Paſſive: And if it were ſubject to any ſuch Conſumptive fire, then ſhould that fire, which is a far more ignoble Creature, have a Being in its greateſt height and glory, when the Being of the Heavens is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Decay, which is too great an abſurdity to be imagined by any that take pleaſure in ſearching into the great Works of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Yea more, conſidering that the conſtant Product of ſuch fire is nothing elſe but Aſhes, it will follow that when the Heavens and the Earth are conſumed, the Aſhes thereof muſt remain in the preſence of God, as if he favoured only the Duſt of the Creatures. But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in ſtead of Aſhes, there ſhall be a glorious Beauty upon the face of Nature at that Day; which beauty even that very fire that ſhall then viſibly flame out, ſhall alſo be a means through the mighty work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the moſt High to bring forth. We will not too curiouſly ſearch into the nature of that fire, poſſibly it may be ſuch as that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42108:73"/>wherein God appeared unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh, but conſumed it not,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ex.</hi> 3.2.</note> and connatural with that which took up <hi>Elias</hi> into Heaven, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying his body, but changing it into a glorious eſtate:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.11.</note> In both which Apparitions, as in many more, the Miniſtry of Angels was imployed, whom, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, God maketh a flaming fire. And therefore when the innumerable multitude of theſe Angels ſhall appear at the laſt Day, waiting upon the Lord Jeſus when he comes in his Glory, well may Heaven and Earth be then ſaid to be in a flame, and, as it were, all on fire.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>But let the Nature of that fire be as it is, ordered by the Wiſdom of the Creatour, far ſurpaſſing our ſhallow Apprehenſions, being ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of thoſe everlaſting Burnings that are in himſelf: This fire at that day ſhall put a new Form and Quality upon the Heavens and the Earth; But how? Or what? I ſay again, we know not, neither is it indeed fit for us to know, while we are in this our preſent eſtate. This we know becauſe God hath promiſed it, there ſhall be new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs, that is, it may be ſuch Heavens and ſuch Earth at leaſt as there was in the beginning, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> dwelt when he was in his Innocency. This alſo we know that the Angels who are this flaming fire, as they are now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by God in the Ordering, Guiding, and Governing the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth which now are, ſo they ſhall in the end be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in making all things new; for they ſhall take away every thing that doth offend, and like unto fire ſeparate the Precious from the Vile, which will neceſſarily bring on a perfect Renovation: and this Renovation is that which will ſurely be the Diſſolution of the former both Heavens and Earth, ſo as they ſhall not be remembred, nor come into minde, according to the word of the Prophet.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſ.</hi> 65.17.</note> Add unto this the melting of the Elements, which the Apoſtle alſo mentioneth, (a plain Metaphorical expreſſion) what doth it imply, but that they ſhall be brought into a new form, even as Mettal when it is melted, loſeth not its ſubſtance, but only the faeculency and droſs is taken away, and the Mettal transformed into another ſhape then it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>And thus in like manner the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> when he had ſpoken (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 102.26.) of the periſhing of the Heavens doth declare what his meaning thereof was in the words immediately following, <hi>viz. All of them ſhall wax old like a Garment,</hi>

                     <hi>as a Veſture ſhalt thou change them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42108:74"/>and they ſhall be changed.</hi> He ſpeaketh not of other Heavens, but the old changed into better: The wrong ſide of the Veſture is for the preſent only diſcernable; but the day ſhall come when it ſhall be ſeen in all its Glory.</p>
                  <p>Unto this we have the concurrent aſſent of Expoſitours both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern, whoſe words becauſe they are ſo clear and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the confirmation hereof, I judge it fit to interſert them at large as I finde them.</p>
                  <p>Holy <hi>Hierom</hi> upon <hi>Iſaiah</hi> writes thus, <hi>Extrema illa Coelorum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio, erit tantum renovatio, &amp; illorum promotio in meliorem ſtatum;</hi> That is, The change which ſhall be of the Heavens at the laſt Day, will be nothing elſe but their Renovation, and a promotion of them to a better eſtate. And in his Commentary upon the 102 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> writing on theſe words, They ſhall periſh and wax old as a Garment, gives his judgment thus, <hi>Coelorum iſte interitus, non erit abolitio corum, ſed reformatio &amp; redintegratio,</hi> that periſhing of the Heavens ſhall not be their Abolition, but their Reformation and Redintegration.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> on the ſame place renders the ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thus, <hi>Peribunt Coeli in fine ſeculi, ſed non peribunt ut animalia, ita ut eſſe deſinant; ſed quia in alium ſtatum transformati, omnibus quae nunc exercent miniſteriis, &amp; functionibus &amp; effectibus carebunt, ut quibus tum non erit opus homini facto jam incorruptibili, cujus gratiâ miniſteria illa exercebant Coeli.</hi> The Heavens ſhall periſh in the end of the World, yet not as other Creatures, ſo as to ceaſe to have any being; but being transformed into another ſtate, they ſhall not have thoſe Operations, Influences and Effects, which now they have; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Man, for whoſe ſake they were employed in ſuch ſervices, being made incorruptible, hath no need of them.</p>
                  <p>The aſoreſaid <hi>S. Hierom</hi> illuſtrates his meaning by a ſimilitude, <hi>v. g. Infans cum in Puerum creverit, &amp; puer in juvenem, &amp; juvenis in virum, &amp; vir in ſenem, nequaquam per ſingulas aetates homo perit; idem enim eſt qui prius fuit, ſed paulatim immutatur &amp; aetati priori videtur periiſſe, ſic etiam &amp; Coeli, &amp;c.</hi> When an Infant groweth up to childhood, from childhood to youth, from youth to mans-eſtate, and from thence to old age, we do not ſay, in his growth and progreſs through theſe ſeveral Ages, that he periſheth from what he was eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; no, he is the ſame perſon, which he was at firſt, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees changed, ſo as to the preceding Age wherein he was, he may
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42108:74"/>ſeem to periſh. Thus is it with the Heavens, they ſhall be changed, which change ſhall be a kinde of periſhing, as to their former eſtate, and a diſſolution of that Frame wherein they ſtood before, but yet nevertheleſs continue in the ſame ſubſtance ſtill, which they were from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſame judgment was <hi>Gregory</hi> ſirnamed the Great, <hi>Quaeri poteſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may be demanded ſeeing the Scripture ſpeaks one while of the eternal duration of the Earth, how it comes to paſs that another while it ſpeaks of a general Diſſolution: <hi>Hoc tamen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile diſcutimus, &amp;c.</hi> This, ſaith he, we can eaſily diſcuſs and reſolve, if we conſider how, and after what manner Earth and Heaven ſhall paſs away, and how they ſhall continue; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>traque enim haec per eam quam nunc habent imaginem peribunt, ſed per eſſentiam tamen ſine fine ſubſiſtunt.</hi> They both paſs away in reſpect of their preſent Form, but their eſſential Being ſhall never fail. And again, <hi>Scriptum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> It is written there ſhall be new Heavens and a new Earth, <hi>Quae qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem non alia ſunt condenda, ſed haec ipſa renovabuntur,</hi> Not as if other diſtinct from theſe ſhall come in their ſtead, but even theſe that are now in being ſhall be renewed. <hi>Coelum igitur &amp; tranſibit &amp; erit, quia &amp; ab eâ quam nunc habet ſpecie, per ignem tergitur, &amp; tamen in ſuâ ſemper naturâ ſervatur;</hi> Heaven therefore ſhall paſs away, and yet ſhall continue, becauſe by fire it is purged from that outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and ſhape, which it now hath, but in its own proper nature ſhall ſtand for ever. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde &amp; per Pſalmiſtam dicitur, mut abis eos &amp; mutabuntur, quam quidem ultimam commutationem ſuam ipſis nunc viciſſitudinibus nobis nunciant, quibus noſtris uſibus indeſinenter alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, &amp;c.</hi> And hence it is ſaid by the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Thou ſhalt change them and they ſhall be changed; which ultimate change of theirs they do in effect themſelves ſignificantly demonſtrate unto us by thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeable Viciſſitudes wherewith they do inceſſantly vary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our uſe and ſervice: for may we not at every turn of the year behold the Earth through the Winter-froſts diſ-robed of all her gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Attire, and when the Spring appears, to flouriſh in as much beauty as ſhe did before? The Heavens in like manner to be covered every day with the darkneſs of the Night, and again to be renewed by the daies Brightneſs. And thus by the continual repair of theſe obvious Defects, we may take ſome gueſs of the future periſhing of theſe things at the laſt Day, and alſo of their refreſhing again by a Renovation.</p>

                  <p>Many more of the Ancients might be alledged, who do unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſent unto this Opinion. So that, whatever ſome people may judge of it now, it is no Recent Device, but a Doctrine that hath been received, as a moſt Genuine Truth in former Ages, yea, and now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in theſe later times it hath been Aſſerted by Modern Divines. I ſhall inſtance in ſome few amongſt a multitude that give their ſuffrage hereunto.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Calvin, Hoc unum de mundi elementis notandum eſt, conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum iri tantum ut novam qualitatem induant, manente ſubſtantiâ.</hi> This one thing is to be noted concerning the Elements of the World, that they ſhall be conſumed only by putting on a new Quality, their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance remaining ſtill the ſame. And Commenting upon theſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>viz.</hi> The Creature is made ſubject to Vanity, he thus writeth, <hi>Dubium non eſt quin vanitatem opponat integrae naturae, &amp;c.</hi> It is not to be doubted but that <hi>S. Paul</hi> oppoſeth the preſent Vanity of the Creature to that perfect Nature which ſhall appear in it hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Polanus, Erunt Coeli novi quia renovati, ſed novis qualitatibus, non ſubſtantiâ.</hi> There ſhall be new Heavens, becauſe they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; but how? Not with a new Subſtance, but new Qualities.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Bucanus, Poſt judicium ſeu reſtaurationem omnium rerum ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des &amp; locus beatorum erit non ſolum in Coelis, ſed etiam in terra.</hi> After the Judgment, or the Reſtauration of all things, the ſeat and place of the Bleſſed ſhall not only be in the Heavens, but alſo in the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Ameſius, Ignis purgando &amp; innovando mundo deftinatus, non an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedet judicium, ſed ſequetur,</hi> That fire ordained for the purging and renewing of the World ſhall not precede the Judgment, but follow it.

                     </gap> only, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's word is in another place (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31.) and which ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue to this very purpoſe) The Figure, the Habit, the Form and Faſhion of the World that ſhall hereafter paſs away, not the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Nature and Eſſence of it; for that ſhall be purified and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in Glory to all Eternity. And though the Scripture ſpeaks of a Conflagration, Diſſolution, and Preterition, which they, who are of a contrary judgment in this Point, do much inſiſt upon; yet ſince they ſpeak no where of an utter Abolition or Annihilation, we may with ſafety abide by what we have declared.</p>
                  <p>But here take this Caution, it behoves us in theſe matters to be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42108:76"/>wiſe according to ſo briety, and in all humble mod eſty to content our ſelves with this general diſcovery of the renovation and reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World; for we ſee the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it in the general term of the Creature, meaning the frame and ſabrick of the World, (as hath been ſaid) conſiſting of Celeſtial and Elementary Regions. Now if we ſhould enter too curiouſly to ſearch what Creatures elſe of the World ſhall be reſtored, what place ſhall contain them, what actions they ſhall have, what properties they ſhall be endued with, wherein they ſhall be ſerviceable and uſeful to the Glorified Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If we ſhould, I ſay, launch out to venturouſly into this Deep, we ſhall not have the Cynoſure of the word to guide us, and ſo ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fall upon the flats of our own fooliſh Imaginations, or run de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately upon the Rocks of moſt dangerous errours, ſuch as <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus</hi> and the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> have done. It is enough for us that we have this general diſcovery made of the Minde of God herein, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Creature ſhall be reſtored and delivered from the bondage of corruption into (or for) the glorious liberty of the Children of God; and that a reparation ſhall be made by Jeſus Chriſt of that which ſin hath ſo much defaced and diſordered.</p>
                  <p>And now to conclude; Doth not all this evidently ſpeak out, that Chriſt will not fail in the exerciſe of his power over the World? But as he began to manifeſt it in the Creation, and to continue it in the preſervation; ſo he will perfect it in the reſtauration of all things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himſelf thereby mightily to be the Son of God, Yeſterday, to Day, and the ſame for ever.</p>
                  <p>But before we diſmiſs this Point, Let us as we have done with the former, bring in ſome few Corolaries to wait upon it; for it is not fit that a doctrine of ſo noble a ſublimity ſhould be without Attendants that may ſome way be uſeful for the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>The firſt then that appears comes with a rule or a rod to rectify an old errour newly revived: For if this truth be admitted, as it muſt unleſs wee will ſhut out the Lord Jeſus Chriſt from a moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent part of his Glory, that is then an Errour to be exploded and repented of, which is very confidently maintained by many in theſe times concerning that outward Glory, made up of a temporal peace, ſafety and happineſs, with an affluence of all good things, which they have imagined the Saints ſhall here in this life be Partakers of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42108:76"/>before the end of the World, grounding their opinion upon ſuch Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture which make mention of this reſtauration that we have inſiſted upon. But if this Reſtauration ſhall not be till after the general Judgment (as hath been made to appear) I hope ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have been of that erroneous perſwaſion, will finde cauſe hereafter to be of another Minde. I will not deny but that upon the downfal of that Man of Sin, the Church may ſhine forth in a more beauteous luſtre in reſpect of ſpiritual Glory before the end com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, then now at this preſent, can be diſcerned in her: but whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that may prove, it ſhall certainly be attended with much trouble from the World, and from the Divel; for the promiſes that are made to the Church while ſhe is Militant,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mor.</hi> 10 30 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.12.</note> are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with this Proviſo, viz. That <hi>ſhe muſt look for Perſecution.</hi> And therefore to look for a Kingdom of Saints here which ſhall continue a thouſand years free from troubles, is ſo Vain a thing that methinks without a ſtrong deluſion of Satan, it ſhould not enter into the hearts of any that pretend to be acquainted with the Counſels of God in his Word. It is not meet that the Spouſe ſhould finde her way through Eaſe and Pleaſure, when her Lord is gone before through much Labour and Sorrow. <hi>The Diſciple is not to be above his Maſter, nor the Servant to be above his Lord: It is enough for the Diſciple that he be as his Maſter, and for the Servant that he hee as his Lord:</hi> If the Maſter of the Houſe was rejected and deſpiſed by men, yea made <hi>a Man of Sorrows</hi> while he was here upon earth;<note place="margin">

The Marriage feaſt that is to be kept betwixt Chriſt and his Spouſe is by the Spirit of God ſweetly called a Supper, And why? <hi>Eo quod eſt ultima refectio,</hi> ſaith one, becauſe it is the laſt refreſhing, wherein all labour and travel being ended, and care laid aſide the Church ſhall enjoy everlaſting quietneſs. But when is it, that the people of God ſhall reſt from their labours? Surely not till ſuch time as they die in the Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. And then when all the Gueſts are meet together, the Lamb and his Bride taking their fills of love each with other, then and not before is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very evil removed, all tears wiped away, the righteous Souls of the Elect ſhall be no more vexed with the wickedneſs of impure So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites, then ſhall they complain no more of the thorn in the fleſh, nor the body of death, nor ſing any more that jarring and lugubrious Song, Why art thou caſt down O my Soul, and why art thou diſquieted within mee? For their Souls at his Supper are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as with marrow and fatneſs, then ſhall there be no more wily Serpent to beguile them, no wraſtling with temptations, no ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with fleſh and bloud, the onely exerciſe then will be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, to triumph, to ſing Hallelujah's to the Lamb, who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited and brought them to this Supper, which ſhall be a continual Feaſt unto them to all Eternity,</p>

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:42108:77"/>
                  <p>The Second Reſultancy holds out a Mirroir wherein we may ſee the Excellency of our Creation. Though we be now brought very Low, being in reſpect of our frailty like unto the Beaſts that Periſh, yet <hi>(fuimus Troes)</hi> we had a Glorious Dominion given us of God over the works of his Hands, as they were in their pureſt Being, when none of the Works of the Divel were Mingled with them, and as they ſhall bee again, when they have paſſed through the Fire, cleanſed from all the Droſs, which now Hangs upon them; A Dominion to which the Creature was willingly Subject, which was their Glory, and as it will be alſo hereafter, when it ſhall delivered from the Bondage of Corruption: A Glory in ſome reſpect like unto that which the Saints whom the King of Heaven delighteth to honour, ſhall enjoy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the general Judgment unto all Eternity; for, ſo much doth that Reſtitution which the Apoſtle mentions imply: A Life (not much Inferiour to the Angels) wherein there was a Familiar Converſe with God himſelf, the Light of God's Countenance ſhining clearly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Eclipſe upon Man, and Man beholding (not as in a Glaſs, but with open Face) the Glory of God, was (not changed) but ſtood firm in the Image of God with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</p>
                  <p>Excellent indeed was the Eſtate, and admirable was that Honour in which our firſt Parents ſtood for a time; I will not, nor cannot ſay how long, but probable it is, that it was longer then it is commonly conceived to be: For beſides that the ſixth Day is concluded by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> with theſe words. <hi>And God beheld all that he had made,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>and loe it was exceeding good, ſo the Evening and the Morning was the ſixth Day.</hi> And beſides the variety of things done after their Creation, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſome Tract of time for their performance, Beſides theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, I ſay, which are not to be ſleighted, that liberty which God gave unto <hi>Adam,</hi> grounded upon a Command, freely to eat of every Tree in the Garden (excepting only one) was made uſe of by him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16, 17.</note> as the words of <hi>Eve</hi> to the <hi>Serpent</hi> do import, before their tampering about the forbidden Fruit: <hi>We may</hi> (ſaith ſhe) or <hi>we do eat,</hi> as it is commonly read <hi>Veſcimur,</hi> of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden, <hi>but of the Fruit of the Tree which is in the midſt of the Garden, we eat not:</hi> And what is the meaning of <hi>We eat?</hi> but this, we are wont to eat, or we have according to God's Command, and his gracious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence and permiſſion, taſted of every Fruit of the Garden beſides this. Which being ſo, I demand how this could be done in that ſhort
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42108:78"/>time of the latter part of that day wherein they were Created? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the taſting of all ſo ſoon could hardly be juſtified from Luxury and waſte, of which they were not guilty in that their innocent and ſinleſs eſtate; and it ſeems to be very unlikely that they would offer to taſte of the Fruit ſo, bidden, until they had taſted of the reſt: Then alſo it might be ſuppoſed, they were well prepared for Satan's temptation; for then and not till then, the commendation of the forbidden Fruit, as of a more excellent kinde then any of the reſt of which they had formerly eaten, might the better allure them both to touch and taſte. The conſideration whereof may be a ground for this Conjecture (wherein I have the Concurrency of a late learned Divine) <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Twiſs.</note> That they continued ſome while after the day of their Creation in that excellent Glory. Which I note the rather, becauſe God's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Creatures, which he had ſo beautified with his own Image, ſhould have as large an extent, as poſſibly can be upon good terms imagined by us: And why we ſhould limit it to a ſhorter time, then is revealed, I ſee not; yea, and the greater was our ſin, that after we had ſome large experience of this great Glory, wherein Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had put us, we ſhould through our abſurd folly deprive our ſelves of it.</p>
                  <p>This for the ſecond Conſideration ariſing from the ſaid Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The third brings a Light in her hand to guide us in the firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and to ſhew us the Glory of the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we are hereby taught to fit and prepare our ſelves againſt this time of Reſtauration, <hi>viz.</hi> By raiſing up our dull, heavy, and carnal hearts from this preſent evil World, where they are too apt to lie groveling; and by ſetting our Affections on things above, and upon this Comfortable time of Refreſhing, wherein the Lord Jeſus will freely and fully manifeſt his love and faithfulneſs unto his beloved people. And indeed ſeeing that theſe things ſhall be diſſolved and again reſtored, What manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs? Scarce any among us, I dare ſay, but do look for new Heavens, and new Earth, that is, expect Salvation in the Day of the Lord. But can we be ſo deluded as to think that the old <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould bring us thither? A Deluſion notwithſtanding it is, wherewith multitudes are miſerably deceived. But beloved Brethren let it be remembred that the flaming Sword which keeps the Way to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42108:78"/>the Tree of Life, will never ſuffer any to enter there under ſuch a Conduct. There muſt dwell nothing but Righteouſneſs, neither ſhall there in any wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27.</note> nor whoſoever worketh Abomination or maketh a Lye. If therefore we carry our ſins along with us, we ſhall certainly ſtand without amongſt Dogs, and never be admitted.</p>
                  <p>Rouze up thy Soul therefore, O poor Sinner, and with Indignation ſhake off whatſoever it be that may hinder thee from having a part in that Glory that ſhall be revealed: For be aſſured the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will never ſuffer his new Creation to be ſullied with the leaſt ſpot or ſtain of Uncleanneſs; He will not have his poor Creature to be ever groaning: and when he hath once freed it, it ſhall be freed for ever; none but the new Creature ſhall be the Inhabitant of his new Creation. Let all old things then be done away both in our hearts and in our lives, and let all things become new. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this firſt Branch with that excellent Gloſs of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> upon that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Non ſubtiliter de igne &amp; procellâ, &amp;c. Disputare voluit Apoſtolus, ſed tantum inde elicere exhortationem (quam mox attexit) nempe ut enitamur nos quoque advitoe novitatem.</hi> The Apoſtle's deſign is not ſubtlely to argue about the ſire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſhall be at the laſt Day, but from the conſideration of the change that ſhall then be, to draw forth an Exhortation to perſwade men to newneſs of life. So ſay I, let us not buſie our ſelves about too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an inquiſition after the manner of that change that ſhall be made of the Heavens and of the Earth, rather it ſhould be our care accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the advice and warning of the Apoſtle, that ſeeing we look for ſuch things as new Heavens and new Earth,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14</note> to give all diligence that we be found of him, who is the faithful Authour of this Change, in peace without ſpot and blameleſs. And thus are we guided by this Doctrine to the firſt Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly it will ſhew unto us ſomewhat of the Glory of the ſecond: For according to the Power and Wiſdom of the Workman, ſo is the Work to be expected that cometh out of his hands; if he be able and expert in his Art whatſoever it be, his Work will be anſwerable, Now it is to be preſumed that Jeſus Chriſt who is the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of God, will like himſelf produce a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Work in his Reſtauration of all things: for herein alſo he will be the ſame which he was from the Beginning. What therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42108:79"/>ſpake in a certain place, may very well be applied to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſ.</hi> 64.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Since the beginning of the World</hi> (for in the beginning there was ſome kinde of reſemblance of that Glory which ſhall be) <hi>Eye hath not ſeen</hi> (as the Apoſtle renders it) <hi>nor Ear heard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.</note> 
                     <hi>neither have entred into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> The Eye of man hath ſeen much, the Ear perhaps hath heard more, but the Heart conceiveth more then Eye hath ſeen, or Ear heard; but Eye, Ear and Heart are all too narrow to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or deſcribe the exceeding weight and ſuperlative Greatneſs of that fulneſs of Glory. It may ſuffice that it is of his wiſe and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful ordering, who is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever. In the 14 of <hi>S. John,</hi> the Lord ſpeaketh to his Diſciples in theſe words (which have a meaſure that reacheth unto all Believers) <hi>I go,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

Being then, I ſay, of his preparation, who is the Lord of Glory, and of his Prepoſſeſſion too, how can it poſſibly be but exceeding Glorious? Kings do not uſe to erect Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, but ſet forth their Magnificence in ſumptuous Buildings. How ſtately then ſhall that place be which is prepared by Jeſus Chriſt the King of Glory? <hi>It was</hi> (as he himſelf faith elſewhere) <hi>prepared from the foundation of the World;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat</hi> 25.34</note> Yet after ſome thouſands of years, he ſaith again, I go to prepare a place for you. (Once more behold here by the way how Jeſus Chriſt is ſtill <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>That Preparation therefore that is to be made, will be it ſeems in part the Reparation of that which was made in the Beginning: In part, I ſay, for it will not become us to mete out, or to ſet Bounds to this great Work of Chriſt by any Topographical Delineations, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then we have the Word to guide us; neither indeed can we poſitively determine what it ſhall be:<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2</note> 
                     <hi>It doth not yet appear,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>what we our ſelves ſhall be,</hi> though for the preſent we be the Children of God; And what the Glory was of our firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are not able in this our low eſtate to finde out, much leſs do we know what that Glory is which Chriſt is preparing. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, this is certain (becauſe it is revealed) there ſhall be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42108:79"/>new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs; and where Righteouſneſs dwelleth, there muſt needs be great Glory: For if Righteouſneſs here, where ſhe is but a Forreiner, and meets with many checks,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.34.</note> exalteth a Nation (as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us) much more will ſhe Adorn and Beautifie the place of her own Habitation, where ſhe ſhineth without any Eclipſe, and where ſhe ruleth without any Diſturbance or Reſiſtance whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>A moſt Glorious Proviſion doubtleſs it will appear to be, which will alſo abundantly ſatisfie. When God was about to bring his people into the Land of Promiſe, he tells them what was prepared for them, <hi>viz. Great and goodly Cities which they builded not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Houſe full of all good things, which they filled not, Wells digged which they digged not, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards and Olive Trees which they planted not,</hi> all ſhould be made ready to their hands againſt their coming thither; ſo ſhall there be a preparation made by Jeſus Chriſt for the Saints in the life that is to come, of all things whatſoever their Souls can deſire.</p>
                  <p>And ſince we have made mention of this Land which the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give unto his People, when he brought them up out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and which is indeed a Symbol of the Eternal Inheritance, let us proceed a little further in this matter, confining our Mediations to a ſhort Parallel between that Land and the Celeſtial <hi>Canaan,</hi> which ſhall be given to all that are <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed for their everlaſting Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>In the third Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ex</hi> 3.8.</note> God tells <hi>Moſes</hi> that <hi>he would bring his People unto a good Land and a large, unto a Land flowing with Milk and Honey, unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebuzites.</hi> Now ſince that Heaven and Earth, as they are prepared by Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be the Receptacle of the Saints hereafter, let us in a ſhort Survey ſee how they will both anſwer their Type in the ſeveral parts thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for Heaven, It is ſurely a good Land (to ſpeak of it by way of Alluſion, the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture leadeth us herein, and that in this very Particular,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16.</note> calling Heaven a Country) Good in reſpect of Vicinity; for where there are good Neighbours, the place is commonly by thoſe that are good the better liked. Now in Heaven there dwells Goodneſs it ſelf, a good God, and a good Saviour, good Angels, and good Souls, All very Good. As it is therefore a part of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42108:80"/>the Torment which the Damned ſuffer in Hell to be ever in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of evil Angels and ugly Devils: ſo ſurely is it a great happineſs to be ever in the ſweet Society of Saints and glorious Angels, nay, of God himſelf. Good then in reſpect of good Neighbourhood; good alſo in reſpect of the abundance of good things that are there: flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſay, not with Milk and Honey, but with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</p>
                  <p>There are good things for the Soul, and good things for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (which being largely laid open by others, we ſhall not inſiſt upon them here) There is the Tree of Life, and the Tree of Knowledge of Good, but not of the leaſt Evil whatſoever. How good is it to behold the King in his Beauty,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſ.</hi> 33.17. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2.</note> to ſee God as he is in his Glory? This is the <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> of the Soul, hitherto ſhe aſpires and no further; For in his preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at his right hand are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore. This is the Priviledge of that place alone, and therefore ſurely it is very good; ſo good, that it is impoſſible it ſhould be better, and impoſſible alſo for us that are ſo evil, as yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know it. Well was it therefore ſung in that Anthem of old, <hi>Quis Chalcedon? Quis Jacinthus? Norunt illi qui ſunt intus;</hi> When once we come to taſte of this Goodneſs, and to drink of the River of theſe Pleaſures, we ſhall then ſee that clearly, which now we can ſee but through a Glaſs darkly.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo a large Land, ſo large that no hand but his that ſtretched it forth can be able to mete it out; though there have been ſome who have too vainly buſied themſelves in calculating the Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it. Some have undertaken to ſet out the extent of it thus: As the Element of Water is ten times bigger then the Earth, the Air ten times bigger then the Water, the Fire ten times bigger then the Air: So with the like proportion each Heaven bigger then another: And thus do the Graſhoppers of the earth skip beyond their Line,<note place="margin">

But away with this Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, far unbeſeeming thoſe that dwell in houſes of Clay, rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhould our thoughts be ſwallowed up with aſtoniſhment, when we take into our conſideration the largeneſs of the Place; and our affections likewiſe ſhould be enlarged towards it, remembring what our Saviour calleth it,<note place="margin">

Well then if this be the manner of men to have Houſe and Land here agreeable to their little Greatneſs, how great and large is that place, where the great God himſelf dwelleth? And where he will gather his Children together into their Manſions or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for them? Surely it is beyond all expreſſion, beyond all admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. We ſhall indeed come to ſee and know it in that day when we walk the Round with Jeſus Chriſt who will certainly then ſhew unto us all the Glory and Beauty of his Houſe, which yeſterday, that is from the beginning, he built and created, and now again in his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is gone to prepare for us, but till then we muſt not be too bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in our ſhallow apprehenſions of it.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42108:81"/>former, the Parallel holds between the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Inheritance; for as God did plant his own choſen people in that good Land,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut</hi> 7.1.</note> from whence he drove out the Heathen, that were the Inhabitants thereof, Nations greater and mightier then they: So will he ſurely bring his Saints into that heavenly Country, which he hath promiſed to give unto them, from whence thoſe Angels (whoſe height was like the height of the Cedars in compariſon of ſuch a poor ſhrub as man is) were for their Rebellion driven into perpetual ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Moreover, as Heaven, which God will give unto his people at the laſt day (being purchaſed and prepared for them by Jeſus Chriſt) may in ſome reſpect be likened unto <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſuch as hath been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; ſo that new Earth, which is alſo to come, may in like manner be reſembled unto it. It is not ſafe to ſpeak of what we have not ſeen, nor to make other diſcoveries concerning this matter, then ſuch as the Holy Ghoſt hath already made. This we may ſay, ſeeing there ſhall be a new Earth wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs, we may affirm it ſhall undoubtedly be a good Land: Abounding, I ſay not again with Milk and Honey, but with ſuch ſtore of Delights, as are proper for Glorified Saints, who ſhall ſtand in no need of any bodily ſuſtenance from the Creature, as they do here in this life. And what a good Land will this be, when there ſhall be nothing in it that doth offend, all the Carkaſſes of the Reprobate purged out of it, and that Curſe which God laid upon it at the beginning quite taken away.</p>
                  <p>It ſhall alſo be a large Land, even the whole compaſs of the Earth, ſhall, at that day to the uttermoſt parts of it, be the Saints Inheritance, that promiſe being then perfectly fulfilled,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Nay further, when there ſhall be no more Sea, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. (which place according to the concurrent judgment of ſundry Divines, is to be underſtood literally, as well as figuratively) That fire (whatſoever it may be) at the Worlds end poſſibly drying it

Behold then, O ye Children of men, what a Glory is prepared for you by Jeſus Chriſt at that great Day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration! Glory in Heaven and Glory in Earth, Glory for your Souls and Glory for your Bodies, wherein you will have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the glorious Angels in a ſpecial reſemblance of Jeſus Chriſt, whereof they are not capable;<note place="margin">

Go up now to <hi>Piſgah,</hi> and in a Spiritual Rapture take a view of your Inheritance before you enter into it. An Inheritance glorious and honourable, wherein you ſhall be Co-heirs with the Lord of Glory; an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſafe and ſure, free from all Intruſions and Encroachments of the World, the Works of the Devil being all deſtroyed,<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10.</note> and the Works of the Earth utterly burnt up, that is, all the Oppreſſions, Pollutions, Snares, Inſinuations, Perſecutions of wicked men and Devils, which formerly troubled you, come to a perpetual end; an Inheritance <hi>Durante vitâ,</hi> to hold ſo long as Eternity it ſelf laſteth, where there are many Manſions, common to all thoſe that are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy to obtain that World; for <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum,</hi> theſe terms Mine and Thine (which make ſuch a ſtrife in this World) ſhall not then be once named amongſt them, as a Language out of uſe, and improper for that Country which is a place of Glory. What ſhall be mine, ſhall be then Yours that now read what is here written, and what ſhall be yours, though you be now Princes of the Earth, ſhall then alſo be mine, though I be now of a lower degree; for we ſhall be all of a Society in this Inheritance, Fellow-heirs and Fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens together, and of the Houſhold of God, united according to a moſt perfect Pattern by an indiſſoluble Bond, even as the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father,<note place="margin">

                  <p>What ſhall we then ſay to theſe things? If Heaven and Earth with all that is therein deſirable will ſatisfie us, we ſhall be fully and perfectly happy. And now let us admire and adore the Lord for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42108:82"/>this his conſtant and unchangeable Goodneſs, and for his wonderful Works, which he hath done from the Beginning, and will alſo do to the Worlds end, even unto all Eternity, for the Children of men: Certainly who ſo is wiſe amongſt us will obſerve theſe things, and ponder this Superlative exceeding weight of Glory that is prepared for them; which whoſoever doth with a quiet and holy dependance upon God for it, they ſhall underſtand more of the loving kindneſſes of the Lord, far ſurpaſſing that which is here but poorly and with a narrow and ſtraitned Spirit revealed unto them.</p>
                  <p>But as for the Tools of the Earth that will not leave their folly, but moſt unthankfully (like the people of old who deſpiſed that good and pleaſant Land,<note place="margin">

Surely it were much better for you to ſtand your ground, and to preſerve your Intereſt with all your ſtrength, preparing your ſelves againſt the time, when an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abundantly into that everlaſting Kingdom,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>The Time of the Old Teſtament with the Legal Ordinances attending upon it, is a Day that is ſet and expired, being Yeſterday; and therefore not to be brought into our account, neither are we to walk in the light of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay not, that the Old Teſtament it ſelf, <hi>Quoad ſcripturam vel ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualem veritatem,</hi> as it is a part of God's Revealed Will unto his Church, is now at this time quite out of date; for even Jeſus Chriſt who is the Sun that ſhineth gloriouſly in this our Day, was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Prophets, as well as of the Apoſtles: and he commandeth us in the New Teſtament to enquire of him in the Old, <hi>Search the Scriptures;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 5.39. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29.</note> that is, enquire into <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, They are they that teſtifie of me: But <hi>Quoad diſpenſationis modum, &amp;c.</hi> The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of God's Preſence with his People are not now after the ſame manner, as in the time of old, and the outward form of his Worſhip which he hath preſcribed is not the ſame with us, as it was with the Fathers: yet nevertheleſs this doth no more impeach the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of the Mediator by whom the change is made, then a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant written and expreſſed more plainly with a diſtinct form of words from what it had before, doth put an imputation of Inconſtancy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that granted it. Of which more ſhall be ſaid hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture is very clear for the confirmation of the propoſed Doctrine. Even Yeſterday was the ſetting of that Day foretold, for <hi>Daniel</hi> prophecied of the putting out of the Light thereof (<hi>Dan.</hi> 9.27.) <hi>viz.</hi>

Anſwerable hereto is that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>The Law and the Prophets were untill John,</hi>

There will be no great need to inſiſt much upon the proof hereof; the Epiſtle to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> is in a manner wholly ſpent upon this Argument: let us ſingle out ſome places wherein the Apoſtle giveth very pregnant teſtimonies concerning this matter.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10.</note> Carnal Ordinances which were the Abecedarian Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42108:85"/>of the Paedagogy of the Law, were the Light of that Day; but theſe Elements are now utterly deſtitute of their former Influence, Luſter, and Vigour, being become but weak and beggarly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. of ſo mean account are they now, even in the judgment of him, who ſaith of himſelf, When he was a childe, he ſpake as a childe, making his boaſt of them,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11.</note> verily thinking with himſelf that he ought to do many things according to thoſe Rudiments; but when he became a man, he put away all thoſe childiſh things. True it is, they had as one ſaith well, been Elements in their time, and God had uſed them as the firſt Letters of the Book to ſchole his People with; but their Office was ended, that fulneſs of Time which brought Chriſt into the World, and that fulneſs of Knowledge and Grace which Chriſt brought with him, was their Diminution. The Light which they gave though Glorious in that Day, is by reaſon of a more excellent Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that now ſhineth, quite extinct and of no value; even as the poor light of a Candle is of no uſe, when the Sun appeareth in his full ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Again, the ſame Apoſtle tells us in the ſame Epiſtle,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23.5.18. and ſo alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. that <hi>we are not under the Law:</hi> And what is the priviledge that we have hereby? Surely very great, for we are not only not under the Curſe of the Law, but not under the guidance and conduct of the Law, as it was in the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 1.17</note> He indeed gave the Law, that is, the Letter of it, and that was all the light that he could give, and the Veil upon his face did then ſhadow out the Veil upon the peoples hearts, which was not taken away in the reading of the Old Teſtament;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.</note> but the Miniſtry of the New Teſtament is not the Miniſtry of the Letter, but of the Spirit; and the Veil which was of old under the Law in the reading of the Old Teſtament, is now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel done away by Chriſt. So that I ſay again, we are not under the Law in the Letter of it, as they of old were, neither can the Veil of <hi>Moſes</hi> hinder us as it did the people formerly.</p>

                  <p>But it may be Objected, was not the Law given ſince upon Mount Sinai? and if we muſt not be juſtified by the works of the Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it revived?</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer with the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>the Law was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19</note> not onely for the reſtraining of them (as it is commonly conceived) though that be a chief end of giving the Law, but becauſe Tranſgreſſions ſo much abounded in the World, when the grace of God had ſo much appeared. In which regard God ſeeing Men ſo Unworthy of his Grace, he revived the Old Covenant again in giving the Law, which was, ſaith the Apoſtle, to continue till the Seed came to whom the Promiſe was made, that ſo men might thereby as by a Schole-Maſter be whipped out of their old Forme, which being come, if any will yet hanker after that old Covenant, the Law ſhall no more be revived for that end as formerly, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation thereof ſhall be added for the Contempt of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Away therefore with all this <hi>Homeſpun</hi> Inherent Righteouſneſs, let it be accounted in the matter of Juſtification before God, even as in truth it is, but a filthy Rag; and when we have done all that we can, given all our Goods to the Poor, and our Bodies to be burned, let us ſay, we are unprofitable Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for the Law, let it be a Guide unto us, as it ought to be, in the way of Holineſs and Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs all the Dayes of our Lives, but we muſt not make it our Guard to preſerve us at any time from Incenſed Juſtice of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42108:90"/>mighty, for therein it will certainly fail: a good Tutour it is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and admoniſh us, but an idle Advocate to plead for us before God's Tribunal, its onely Exerciſe there, being to Accuſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn.</p>
                  <p>A Third ſort that Unſeaſonably buſy themſelves with Yeſterday<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who have a long time ſet up the Ceremonial Law of Moſes in the Worſhip and Service of God, who are it ſeems, and ſtill will be Children, led on by weak and beggarly Elements, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding at this time are not any Help unto them at all, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Hinderance in reſpect of any Spiritual Edification: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they pretend to promote the Goſpel, and to advance the Honour of Chriſt, they do in effect by their Conformity to the Moſaical Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogy, deny and forſake them both. To what purpoſe are their Altars, their Prieſts, their Sacrifices, their Waſhings, Unctions, Shaving, Sprinkling, Purifying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To what End, I ſay, are theſe many other the like beggarly Ceremonies, but to bring a Vail over the Goſpel, and to call back Yeſterday, to which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath pronounced a <hi>conſummatum eſt?</hi> And if they be not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, Chriſt himſelf hath not yet finiſhed his Work for which he was ſent into the World; and then where are we?</p>
                  <p>There need not much be ſaid concerning this matter. The affront that is hereby put upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ſo notorious, that it is diſcernable by all that are not given up to ſtrong Deluſions.</p>
                  <p>To conclude therefore, it is very well noted by one who hath a long time been a laborious Workman in the Lord's Vine-yard, that the Lord by Burying the dead Body of Moſes in an unknown place, did in a kinde, ſignify that he hath ſo aboliſhed the Legal Ordinances, that they muſt be buried in eternal Oblivion, and never to be looked after, nor minded any more. Whoſoever therefore ſhall now go about to revive any of thoſe Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emonies of the Law, as the Papiſts do, their Work is no other in God's eyes then the raking up of Moſes's Dead Body which the Lord hath concealed. Such a Cenſure likewiſe giveth Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> when he had ſpoken of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that they were to have a Solemn Funeral, which would require ſome time (upon which account were the Apoſtles excuſable for their temporary connivence at them) He addeth, <hi>Quisquis nunc</hi> &amp;c. Whoſoever ſhall now uſe them, as it were raking them up out of their
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42108:90"/>Duſt, he ſhall not be <hi>pius deductor corporis, ſed impius violator ſepal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae</hi>) A pious Helper in the Burial, but an impious and ſacrilegious Wretch that ranſakes the quiet Tombs of the Dead.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, ſuch who now-a-dayes Pretend to Oracles, that is, Viſions and Revelations, and wait for Miracles, may by this Doctrine be convinced of a woful Deluſion wherewith they are Haunted; for it will appear, that even theſe alſo were the Light of Yeſterday. Indeed when God was letting forth Light by little and little, now a part of his Word, and then a part of his word, he did at that time, as hath been ſaid before, reveal his Minde ſundry ways: but now, when the Day is not onely Dawned, but the Sun of Righteouſneſs is come forth out of his Chamber, appearing like a ſtrong man in his Race, God doth not uſe to interpoſe Heterogeneous Flaſhes of Light, differing from that which he hath in his Wiſdom and Goodneſs ſet forth to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Light to all the World. The Firmament of Heaven cannot endure two Suns, yea horrid Confuſion would ſeaze upon the Face of Nature, if ſuch a thing were; even the <hi>Parelii,</hi> that is, Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of the Sun in the Aire, uſually called Mock Suns, are Praemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours of fearful Prodigies like to enſue: and theſe new Lights dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the ordinary Light of our Day, have not onely Portended, but brought on Diſmal and Lamentable Diſaſters upon the poor Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Viſions and Revelations were the Light of Yeſterday; and though there were ſome ſuch Manifeſtations of it now and then,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 89.19</note> when it was in <hi>Occaſu,</hi> in the inſtant of Setting in the Primitive Times, as there were Prophecies and Jewiſh Ceremonies, of which we finde ſome, though very rarely, were taken up and made uſe of (for after a Shower will come ſome Drops:) yet to expect them now, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any need of them at this time, when with open Face we do behold the Glory of the Lord, and this Glory of the Lord likewiſe ſhines clearly unto us, in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt, what were this but ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ingratitude? It is as if a man ſhould exclaim againſt the Light of the Sun, and call for a Candle to be ſet up at High-noon Day.</p>

In which reſpects it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged our State is far more excellent then theirs.</p>
                  <p>From whence we may Collect with a late Writer,<note place="margin">Mr. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins.</note> who in his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration laboured much in the Lord, That Revelations of God's Will to be expected now under the Goſpel, are ordinarily nothing els but theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The true Senſe and Meaning of Holy Scripture and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning of True Scripture from Forged, of True Sacraments from Suppoſed, of True Doctrines from Falſe, of True Paſtours from Falſe Prophers; theſe and ſuch like as far forth as they are neceſſary to Salvation, all true and faithful Believers (which out of an humbled Heart, do ſeek it by devout Prayer at God's hand) are ſure to have revealed unto them from God Pſ. 25.14.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 25.14.</note> But as for other Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God <hi>viz.</hi> of Perſonal and particular matters, or what ſhall be his bleſſings, or what his Judgments to theſe and theſe Men, Families, Cities or Kingdoms, or when, or how he will change States or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Kingdoms, or by what extraordinary means he will have his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel propagated, or a declining Church or State upholden, theſe we are not now to expect nor eaſily to believe any that ſhall ſay, ſuch things are revealed unto them.</p>
                  <p>And yet as the ſaid Authour ſaith well, we do not hereby limit the Almighty, or tie the Lord in ſuch ſtrait Bonds, but he may ſometimes extraordinarily reveal his Purpoſe in ſome ſuch Caſes to ſome of his ſelected Servants, provided that that Revelation be examined and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of by the Church.

                  <p>And the truth is, it is but neceſſary that ſuch reſtrictions ſhould be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42108:91"/>in this Caſe, which undoubtedly God doth allow of; it being a moſt certain rule, <hi>Deus non deficit in neceſſariis,</hi> God is not wanting in things neceſſary. Now ſurely this is needful. For though the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures are not to wait upon the allowance of the Church, rather let the Church ſtand or fall to the infallible Judicature of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; yet this Power hath the Church given unto her of God, to judg of extraordinary Revelations, whether they be of God or no; neither are they to be of any account with the people of God, till they have paſſed the Scrutiny and Cenſure of the Church: otherwiſe what dangerous Conſequences would follow hereupon, it is not any hard matter to foreſee.</p>
                  <p>Here we ſhall have one cry out <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>I have Dreamed, I have Dreamed,</hi> as thoſe Impoſtours did <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.25.<note place="margin">

                  <p>There another will come and pretend Impulſes of Spirit (as ſome of late have impudently done in this Nation) for the juſtifying of his courſel, though the unwarrantableneſs of it, be made ſo plain to his Face, that it is paſt all Gainſaying.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſeeing that Satan transforms himſelf into an Angel of Light, what meanes ſhall we have to diſtinguiſh between Diabolical Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the Infuſions of the Spirit of God, if every man may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon us what he pleaſeth for a Divine Revelation.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>we have a more ſure word of Prophecy</hi> (as the Apoſtle writeth 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19) my meaning is, we have the Holy Scripture,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19</note> whereunto we ſhould do well to take heed, and to have a ſtanding Word to be a conſtant Light unto us, which is the Light of this our Day, is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then to have the ſeveral glimmerings of Revelations, which were the Light of Yeſterday; and if we will not believe Moſes and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, our Faith will be little furthered by Viſions and Revelations.</p>
                  <p>Say not therefore, <hi>who ſhall aſcend into Heaven?</hi> that is, to bring Chriſt down from above, even to pull the Sun of Righteouſneſs out of his Orb; <hi>or who ſhall deſcend into the Deep?</hi> that is to bring up Chriſt again from the Dead, this were to overturn the Series of thy Salvation; <hi>the Word is nigh thee,</hi> and therefore content thy ſelf with it, and ſeek not to call back Yeſterday, which doth not belong unto thee (This Scripture <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8.<note place="margin">

                  <p>O but may ſome ſay, if there were Miracles wrought now amongſt us, as there were formerly, would not this conduce much to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the Faith.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer this alſo was Yeſterday's Light, therefore of no uſe unto us: and though it did continue alſo a while at the Dawning of our Day, yet it ſerved onely for the manifeſting of Chriſt unto the World, and the Propagating of the Goſpel in thoſe Primitive Times. To this purpoſe ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr, fuerant miracula ut buccinae &amp; praecones, quibus Evangelium commendabatur,</hi> Miracles were as Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and Harbingers whereby the Goſpel, at its firſt appearance, was proclaimed and made glorious.; which being done the Trumpets became uſeleſs,<note place="margin">Non nunc ut olim ſunt neceſſaria miracula.

                     </note> and therefore fit to be laid aſide.

                     <hi>yee will not believe;</hi> Be it known unto you that the Heavenly Oracles by which we are guided in this our Day, are accompanied with continued and ſtanding Miracles, though Miracles of a more ſpiritual nature: what is the demoliſhing of the Fortifications of Fleſh and bloud, and caſting down of ſtrong Holds, mortifying the Old Man, which is our corrupt Nature, and ejecting the ſtrong Man, which is the Devil out of the Hearts of Sinners, whereby the Arm of Lord is made Bare, and the Spirit of Chriſt in the Goſpel exerciſeth its Virtue and Vigour more abundantly, then ever (it being as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>the day of the Lord's Power</hi>) More Divels being Caſt out ſince Chriſt's Aſcenſion, then were before, what I ſay, are theſe but Miracles? The Miracles which the Lord wrought, when he was upon Earth, were indeed the Product of an Almighty Power; yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf tells his Apoſtles, that they, and not onely they, but others that ſhould be employed in the ſame Miniſtery after them,<note place="margin">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42108:92"/>things then thoſe,</hi> whereby he ſeemeth to mean the Converſion of Men to the Faith by the Preaching of the Goſpel: to this purpoſe ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> who himſelf was a Miracle both in his Converſion and Converſation, <hi>Mundi ad Chriſtum converſio per Apoſtolos &amp; alios facta, omnium miraculorum maximum eſt miraculum,</hi> the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World unto Chriſt is of all Miracles the greateſt. Neither is this an Hyperbole, conſidering (as it hath been obſerved) that by ſo inconſiderable, ſo deſpicable meanes, againſt ſo implacable, ſo powerful enemies, Truth ſhould triumph, and ſo mightily prevail, as that the Conquered ſhould command, ſubdue, and at length give Laws to the Conquerours, till almoſt the whole World became her Convert, Reaſon cannot conclude leſs, then <hi>non hac ſinc Numine,</hi> this muſt needs be the Lord's doing. A Miracle well worthy of Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that by the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching, ſo many Millions have been Converted, and made Wiſe unto Salvation. To open the Eyes of the Minde, is without all queſtion more then to give bodily ſight; to make the Deaf to hear, and the Dumb to ſpeak, were indeed great things: But to pronounce <hi>Ephatha</hi> to the Heart and Mouth of a Wretch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately ſet againſt Chriſt and his Goſpel, and he thereupon Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to riſe up, and give Glory to God, what can it argue but a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Work and a Wonder? It was a Wonder heretofore to hear of <hi>Saul</hi> amongſt the Prophets, inſomuch that it grew to a Proverb,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10 12</note> 
                     <hi>Is Saul alſo among the Prophets?</hi> and is it not as great a Wonder, to hear of <hi>Saul</hi> among the Apoſtles? That he who perſecuted the Saints in time paſt, ſhould after preach the Faith, which he once Deſtroyed?<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now if ſuch Changes and Converſions were in other material or ſenſible things, as from Water to Wine, from Iron to Gold, or a Tranſition from one Species to another, what aſtoniſhment would ariſe thereupon? whereas in Spirituals, this Changing is more Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, though leſs diſcernable.</p>
                  <p>So then Miracles there are alſo in theſe times ſufficient to evidence the Truth and Power of the Goſpel, and to confirm the Faith of thoſe that do believe; though not ſuch as were of Yeſterday, which is paſt, with all the Appurtenances of it, and muſt not be recalled, as hath been ſaid; and therefore Men had beſt beware how they quarrel at the preſent Diſpenſations of Grace, by a pretended Zeal, after the Light of Yeſterday, leaſt that of our Saviour be in the end Charg'd upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Light is come into the World,</hi>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42108:94"/>of the Point in hand, it ſhall here be made evident that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was the ſame Prophet, King, and Prieſt of his Church ever from the Beginning: and if upon a due Inquiry we finde it to be ſo, I hope it will then be granted on all hands, that he was the Saviour of his Church from the Beginning alſo.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The ſame Prophet ab initio.</note>To begin with the firſt, Jeſus Chriſt fulfilled the office of a Prophet in all thoſe Primitiar times of the World, making known the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God unto Men, which without him muſt for ever have been concealed from them, and giving an effectual Virtue to thoſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which in their Order and Time were inſtituted and eſtabliſhed in his Church.</p>
                     <p>Hence is he by the Prophet <hi>Eſaiah</hi> called <hi>Wonderful Counſellour</hi> (for ſo theſe two Words are to be joyned) as much as to ſay,<note place="margin">

                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Jam</hi> 4 12</note> Now this one Lawgiver muſt undoubtedly be that one Mediatour, becauſe when man had by his diſobedience violated the firſt Law given him by God himſelf, he was immediately thereupon become an <hi>Exlex,</hi> an accurſed Out-law, and ſo ſhould have continued given up to confuſion and every evil work, had not the Mediatour (in whom the Father was pleaſed all fulneſs ſhould dwell) then inſtantly appeared, exerciſing his Regal Authority in reducing man into ſome order, both for his quiet and peaceable living here in this world, and to make way for him into everlaſting Happineſs hereafter. Which work, I ſay, was alwaies the proper work of the Mediatour, for it was not conſiſtent with Divine Juſtice to give a Law any more to ſuch a Rebel, but rather to let him alone to periſh for ever in his Apoſtacy which muſt certainly have followed, if Chriſt had not interpoſed his Mediation; the virtue whereof as in ſome ſort it extended to all Mankinde, yea to the whole Creation, ſo it was chiefly fixed upon that People whom God had elected to himſelf for his peculiar Inheritance.

                     <p>Once, It is manifeſt that this Scripture is not limited to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſenſe, but doth carry with it a various ſignification: To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that Application of it (which is made by ſome, eſpecially one of very eminent note in the Church) to the Birth of Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Biſhop</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews.</note> when he took upon him our Nature, deriving the Warrant thereof from <hi>Act.</hi> 4.25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We finde the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5.</note> 
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. alledging this place to prove the Deity of Chriſt, as one, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was far above, far more excellent, then the Angels <hi>(for to which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thee.)</hi> Signifying the Fathers eternal, prepetually-conſtant, and preſent Generation of his Son, which ſheweth him to be very God. We finde alſo the ſame Apoſtle applying it to the Reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33. in theſe words, <hi>He</hi> (that is, God) <hi>hath raiſed up Jeſus again, as it is written in the Second Pſalm, Thou art my Son,</hi>

                        <hi>this day have I begotten thee.</hi> So that in this ſenſe, the Prophet's word there <hi>Hodie,</hi> to Day, ſignifies the Day of Chriſt's Reſurrection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was begotten from the Dead; for ſo he is denominated, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The firſt begotten from the Dead;</hi>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42108:99"/>very ſame word <hi>Hodie,</hi> implies that Eternity, which properly hath neither beginning of Daies, nor end of Time. Since therefore the word of the Holy Ghoſt here, is comprehenſive of various Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we may ſafely without relinquiſhing thoſe which the Apoſtle hath given, render this alſo which hath been here inſerted (unleſs we will entertain that Novel and Jeiune Opinion of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, no more but one meaning of one Text) <hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt was begotten of the Father to be the Mediatour the very day that he firſt entred upon his Office, that is, at that inſtant time when the firſt Promiſe was made, <hi>viz. The Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Clearly then Jeſus Chriſt was Yeſterday the King of his Church, as well as to Day, becauſe he was the Lawgiver from the beginning: yea upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> that Law which was written in Tables of ſtone by the Finger of God, was the Act and Deed of this King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>Quid enim eſt digitus Dei niſi Spiritus Dei,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> What is the Finger of God, but the Spirit of God, as may appear by comparing <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.20. And whatſoever was done by the Spirit to the people of God, was alſo done by Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour: His Act it was, and in his Cuſtody or Regiſter was it alſo kept, being laid up in the Ark under the Propitiatory (which was a moſt ſingular and illuſtrious Type of Jeſus Chriſt) and ſo alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under his ordering and diſpoſing, as ſeemed good unto him.</p>
                     <p>Now let me not be miſtaken herein, I do not ſay, that Chriſt as Mediatour gave any Law at all, as it may have a conſonancy with the Covenant of Works, which indeed the Law hath unto all thoſe who will not be brought into the Bond of the new Covenant: But this I ſay, The Goſpel of the Law which the faithful people of God have alwaies found therein, that is, the Doctrine of Faith and Repentance was undoubtedly (as I hop-hath been made clearly to appear) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Chriſt, as well as the Law of the Goſpel; in which reſpect it is alſo called <hi>the Law of Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 6.2. And the Prophets who were the beſt Expounders of the Law,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2.</note> did alwaies in their ſeveral Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions derive from thence the ſaid Evangelical Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Again, As the Legiſlative Power was Yeſterday in Chriſt, ſo in like manner was the Punitive and Vindictive, both for the correction of his People when they offended, and for the puniſhment and cutting off his Enemies, when they grew implacable in their rage, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible under his Judgments. A Lawgiver we know will be of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42108:99"/>no account, unleſs he be a Judge, and he that is a King, unleſs he be a Judge and a Lawgiver both; he may have an aiery ſtyle of Majeſty given unto him, and pleaſe himſelf with the ſight of a Crown and Scepter: but as to true and real power he ſhall (as hath been ſaid, and we have found it by experience to our ſhame and miſery too too true) remain but the out-ſide, but the Picture, but the ſign of a King. If then the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath been the Lawgiver of his Church of old, and conſequently the King, it muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that he was the Judge alſo both to interpret the meaning, and to execute the penalty of his Law. Thus therefore we finde thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices linked together (as is before ſaid) with a reference to Jeſus Chriſt under the Law;<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The Father judgeth no man,</hi> that is, immediately, <hi>but hath committed all judgment unto the Son. Muſculus</hi> according to his uſual wont obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth here, It is not ſaid judgment alone, but all judgment; and in that it is ſaid all, it plainly ſheweth, that his power is of ſo large an extent that it reacheth unto all that ever were in the world: For when was it that the Father gave this power of Judicature unto the Son? When, but <hi>Quando cum genuit</hi> (ſay ſome Orthodox Ancients, very pertinently,<note place="margin">Chryſoſtom Hilarius, Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact.</note> though they miſtook in their computation of this <hi>Quando,</hi> limiting it unto Eternity, as <hi>Pererius</hi> noteth) when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat him, which is not to be underſtood of his Divine Generation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in that reſpect the Father and the Son judge both alike after the ſame manner, being equal in power from everlaſting to everlaſting. But here it is ſaid, the Father judgeth no man, having devolv'd that power wholly upon the Son. How then? It muſt ſurely be meant of the time, when Chriſt was begotten of the Father to be Mediatour, and when that was, hath been before ſaid: which being ſo, Chriſt was the Judge from the beginning, and conſequently the King of the Church from the beginning alſo.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, the exerciſe of this power wherewith the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was veſted from the beginning, was in like manner alwaies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by him in the executing of judgment; for as he addeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42108:100"/>
                        <hi>John</hi> 5.27. <hi>The Father gave him Authority to execute judgment alſo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>John</hi> 5.27</note> 
                        <hi>becauſe he is the Son of man;</hi> which Scripture though it may be applied, and that properly to the laſt judgment, when Chriſt ſhall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly appear as a Judge, yet it is not to be limited to that ſenſe, but hath a meaſure that reacheth unto the Church in all Ages, wherein Chriſt hath according to the Authority given him of the Father execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted judgement.</p>
                     <p>If it be now objected that theſe words, becauſe he is the Son of man, do imply that Chriſt did not execute this power till he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him our Nature; I ſhall anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If Chriſt was the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world, though notwithſtanding he was not actually ſlaughtered till about the eighteenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> what hinders but that he might be alſo the Son of man before his Incarnation? Sure we are, the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> ſpeaks of him under that notion. And ſome there are that apply that of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> unto him;<note place="margin">Dan. <hi>7.13.</hi> Ravanel. Ius, &amp;c. Pſ. <hi>80.17.</hi> In his Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 
                        <hi>Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the Son of man, whom thou madeſt ſtrong for thy ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, I anſwer with learned Biſhop <hi>Mountague,</hi> that this ſtile wherewith Chriſt was pleaſed very frequently to denominate himſelf <hi>(Son of Man)</hi> is to be underſtood with a reference to that original Promiſe, the firſt of all made unto Mankinde, <hi>The Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head,</hi> and not unto any perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever to whom Chriſt might be related according to the fleſh. And hereby, ſaith <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> did the Lord intimate that himſelf was the Party meant in that Promiſe; and that the virtue of his Merits ſhould be and was diffuſed to all Nations in the world <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally alike deſcended of the woman, who both had a like intereſt in the woman and her Seed, though the <hi>Jews</hi> did and might challenge greater propriety in the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> then the <hi>Gentiles</hi> could.</p>
                     <p>This Title then upon this account doth rather confirm the matter in hand, then in the leaſt Iota appear againſt it. But I do further offer to conſideration; Did not Chriſt call himſelf <hi>the Son of man,</hi> that he might thereby intimate to the Sons of men, for their comfort, that there was ſome kinde of Affinity between him and them, he being <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the eſſential Reaſon from all Eternity, as is before ſaid; and they, men endued with reaſon alſo through his good hand upon them in their Creation, and therefore he would delight in that Appellation ſince he had undertaken to be their Mediatour, which might even in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42108:100"/>their apprehenſion advance that Affinity? Which if it be ſo, Chriſt doth not call himſelf the Son of man, ſo much for his being a Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant from Mankinde; But Son of man he is, that is, by an <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> Man <hi>per excellentiam,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</note> (as the Apoſtle alſo calls him) as one that was Superiour to them all, and from whom they all, being reaſonable Creatures, have derived their diſtinction from other Species in the World about them.</p>
                     <p>From all which it may appear, that Jeſus Chriſt might be called the Son of man before his Incarnation, and therefore as ſuch did exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that Authority which the Father had given unto him.</p>
                     <p>He executed judgment on <hi>Cain,</hi> when he excommunicated him out of his Church, as may be gathered from the Sentence of Malediction which he pronounced upon him, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould be a Fugitive and a Vagabond in the Earth;<note place="margin">

                     <p>And now to conclude this Point, (wherein poſſibly I may be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with over-much Prolixity, but that the advancement of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Jeſus Chriſt will I hope be a ſufficient excuſe and plea for me among thoſe that take pleaſure in the promoting thereof) It is I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve very clear and evident by what hath been here ſaid, That the Lord Jeſus was the King of his Church Yeſterday, as well as to Day.

                     <p>In the purſuance of this Point we ſhall fix our diſcourſe principally upon two places of Scripture, which will, I believe, make it evident and manifeſt unto all. And firſt, very remarkable is that which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of Chriſt in the 110 <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110.4.</note>

                     <p>For the continuance, it is an eternal Prieſthood, to laſt for ever, which word <hi>for ever,</hi> comprehendeth in it the whole time and age of the Church from the beginning: Or if it be limited to time to come, it is to be underſtood with a reference unto Chriſt's firſt entrance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Mediatorial Office, which was then when the new Covenant paſſed between God and Chriſt in the behalf of poor man, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the violation of the firſt, as hath been ſaid before. And this poſſibly may be the reaſon why the Apoſtle ſpeaking very frequently of Chriſt's eternal Prieſthood (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6, 7 Chapters) ſtill renders this word, <hi>for ever,</hi> in the Singular Number, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </note> becauſe Chriſt's Prieſtly Office was not to take in that time, wherein our firſt Parents ſtood in the ſtate of Innocency, but only that <hi>ſeculum</hi> which was to enſue even unto the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>If it be objected that Chriſt was made Prieſt ſince the Law, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Heb.</hi> 7.28.) That <hi>the Word of the Oath, which was ſince the Law maketh the Son high Prieſt, who is Conſecrated for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> I anſwer, firſt, Although the Word of the Oath as it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>David,</hi> came after the Law given upon Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> yet the Oath it ſelf might notwithſtanding be made at the firſt making of the Covenant, and ſo the word of the Prophet implies, being rendred
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42108:102"/>in the Pretertenſe, <hi>The Lord ſware,</hi> as a thing that had been done long before. Secondly, If the Law there be to be taken with a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Covenant of Works given to <hi>Adam,</hi> of which Covenant the Law given upon <hi>Sinai</hi> was in ſome reſpect a Renovation, then it will be clear that this Oath was made in the time prefixed, <hi>viz.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the paſſing of the new Covenant. Thirdly, If it ſhould be limited to the time after the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet it appeareth not by the words of the Apoſtle, that the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt was not effectual before; for though it be rendred in our Engliſh Verſion, The Word of the Oath which was ſince the Law maketh the Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it is not ſo in the Original: the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which is tranſlated <hi>Maketh,</hi> not being in this latter clauſe of the Verſe, as it is in the former, but poſſibly ſome other word ſignifying a Confirmation of the Son in his Office, may be there by the Apoſtle underſtood; or the very word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> may carry with it ſuch a ſignification: But in theſe things I ſhall ſubmit unto better Judgements.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Order according to which Chriſt's Prieſthood is confirmed, is the Order of <hi>Melchizedek;</hi> who this <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was, is needleſs here, yea, unlawful at any time to ſearch out. But for his Order we are to enquire unto it. And albeit he himſelf was not known by name in the world till about 2000 years after the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently no real reſemblance could be made of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time; yet that hindreth not but that Chriſt's Prieſthood from the beginning might be ſaid to be according to his Order in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and foreknowledge of God, and have a virtual operation long before, though the actual ſuſception and adminiſtration of the Office by <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was not till 2000 years after. By order then or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, as it is called,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.15.</note> 
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.15. is meant the ſtate or condition of <hi>Melchizedek</hi> in the execution of his Office, and that was according to the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>After the power of an endleſs life; for he was without father,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.3.</note> 
                        <hi>without mother, without deſcent, having neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of daies nor end of life</hi> (according to his Scriptural being.) The meaning whereof in ſhort is this, His Prieſthood was an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Prieſthood: Anſwerable hereunto and home to our purpoſe, ſuch alſo is the Prieſthood of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> An everlaſting Prieſthood; for as <hi>Melchizedek</hi> in his Scriptural being had neither beginning nor end, but a Prieſt he was before any mention is made of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18. And the Apoſtle ſaith of him alſo, that <hi>he abideth a Prieſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42108:102"/>Heb.</hi> 7.3. So in like manner was the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in effect a Prieſt long before his appearance in the world according to the fleſh, and continueth to be a Prieſt ſtill now when he hath left the World. Thus doth this Scripture witneſs that Jeſus Chriſt was a Prieſt yeſterday.</p>
                     <p>The next Scripture that we ſhall make uſe of to this end, ſhall be that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Every high Prieſt taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God,</hi>

                           <hi>Heb</hi> 5.1.</note> 
                        <hi>that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for ſins.</hi> Where we may ſee the properties of the high Prieſt deſcribed, to ſhew the truth of them in Chriſt, which upon due examination we ſhall finde to be fulfilled by him Yeſterday, as well as to day.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It was requiſite that the high Prieſt ſhould be ſever'd and ſet apart from the common multitude: for ſo the words there, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (that is, being taken from Men) do moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifie.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ex</hi> 28.1.</note> Thus was <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons ſever'd and ſet apart for the Prieſts Office by the commandment of God: And as the <hi>Aaroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Prieſt was thus ſever'd, ſo was Chriſt; for though he had not his bodily being amongſt men, till he was made of a woman, yet he was ſet apart and deſtin'd by God to be the Prieſt of his Church from the beginning, and his Office was virtually in force before his ſolemn and publick undertaking thereof in the daies of his fleſh.</p>
                     <p>Which Aſſertion that it may not ſeem ſtrange, I ſhall endeavour to make it plain by an inſtance of ſomewhat the like nature.</p>
                     <p>When our firſt Parents had by their Diſobedience thrown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under God's Diſpleaſure, all the whole Race of Mankinde was then involv'd in the ſame Hazard; all of us, I ſay, were then, before we had ſuch an Alternate being, as we have had ſince in the World, by ſucceeding Generations, brought under the Axe of Divine Juſtice, and that by ſuch a way and manner, which we are not able now to comprehend; every Mothers Childe (as we ſay in our ordinary Proverb) ſtood then at the Bar of God's dreadful Tribunal ready to be haled away to execution. And this I ſuppoſe will be eaſily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Well then, If we were all preſent at that time in a likely way of an everlaſting Perdition, How came it to paſs that a Pardon was then Actually given to ſome, and Potentially for others, if Chriſt our high Prieſt was not, according to his Capacity of being a Mediatour at time, preſent alſo? But being ſo, as continual experience hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42108:103"/>clear demonſtration, he was then unqueſtionably ſet apart by the Father from the common multitude to perform that Office: which Office, I ſay, he then began, and afterwards continued it in the firſt-born, one Generation after another before the Law, putting an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency upon them and their Offerings, which gave them a ſpecial Intereſt in the favour of God above their Brethren. Again, when it ſeemed good to the Divine Wiſdom under the Law to divert the courſe of holy and religious Service at God's Altar from the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> even thoſe Levitical Prieſts had Chriſt's Concurrency with them in the execution of their Office; for when God had commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> (<hi>Ex.</hi> 30.30.) to Anoint the Prieſts with ſacred Oyl,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ex.</hi> 30.30.32.</note> in the 32 Verſe he forbiddeth to Anoint man's fleſh with it. How ſhall we untie this Knot (ſaith Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi>) Prieſts muſt be Anointed with the holy Oyl, but men may not? Surely it implieth that that Prieſthood ſurpaſſed the height of all humane Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, becauſe of the Relation it had to Jeſus Chriſt in his virtual Concurrency with it. It appeareth then that Chriſt was ſet apart for this Office from the beginning.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>the high Prieſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>is ordained for men in things pertaining to God,</hi> That is, was appointed to employ all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with God for man's good: He was, ſaith Biſhop <hi>Reynolds,</hi> to be a middle Perſon to ſtand and miniſter between God and Man in their behalf, to be impartial and faithful towards the Juſtice and Truth of God, and not to be over-ruled by his love to Men to injure him, and to be compaſſionate and merciful towards the errours of men, and not to be over-ruled by his Zeal to God's Juſtice to give over the care and ſervice of them. And ſuch an high Prieſt was Chriſt, zealous of his Fathers Righteouſneſs and Glory, for he was ſet forth to declare the Righteouſneſs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. And he did Glorifie him on earth by finiſhing the things which he had given him to do;<note place="margin">

                     <p>Now ſince Chriſt was ordained thus for the good of men,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14.</note> can it be imagined that he had a care only of that ſort of men that came after him into the World and none at all of thoſe that had been before? Was <hi>Abraham</hi> the Friend of God, and <hi>David</hi> the man after Gods own heart, of no reckoning with him? If ſo, let that accurſed Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ancient <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> the firſt-born of the Devil have a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42108:103"/>to paſs without controll that no man was ſaved, all went to Hell unto the 15 year of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> wherein it was from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven revealed, concerning Chriſt, This is my beloved Son, hear him. Or was there ſome other Mediatour before Jeſus Chriſt took upon him our Nature, who did execute that Office for 4000 years, and then reſign'd it up to the Son of God, leaving the reſidue to be done by him in a time which happily may not be half ſo long? Or were all thoſe that lived in that long Tract of time ſhut up in <hi>Limbo</hi> when they died, from whence they could not be delivered till Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf came among them? Theſe and ſuch other <hi>Carcinomata</hi> (as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Mountague</hi> calls them) are rather for Cauteries then curing Salves to work upon, we may perhaps meet with ſome of them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: undoubtedly the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was alwaies The man, who was, is, and ſhall be the Mediatour between God and Man.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The high Prieſt was to offer Gif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s and Sacrifices for Sins, that ſo Divine Juſtice might be ſatisfied, which had been by ſin viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Hence it was that as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Almoſt all things were by the Law purged with bloud,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12.</note> 
                        <hi>and without ſhedding of bloud is no remiſſion.</hi> Death was to attend upon Juſtice, as her Executioner, but if Juſtice paſs a Sentence at any time, and execution follow not upon it, Juſtice vaniſheth into nothing, and is become a meer <hi>Ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium,</hi> for Execution is the very life of Juſtice; Death therefore, ſince he is let into the World by mans ſin, muſt do its office, that ſo Juſtice may live: Accordingly did the Prieſts who were ordained to ſee that a due ſatisfaction ſhould be made to Divine Juſtice, and to make an Atonement for the people, never come before the Lord without bloud: But firſt they ſlew the Sacrifice upon the Altar, and then took of the bloud,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.11 15.</note> and brought it before the Mercy-ſeat within the Veil, to teſtifie the death of the Sacrifice, whereupon Sin was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated, and Juſtice fully ſatisfied. Thus did the Prieſts under the Law, and thus alſo did Chriſt, without whom all whatſoever they did had been to no purpoſe, their ſacrificing of a Lamb had been of no more account with God, then the cutting off of a Dogs Neck, and there offering an Oblation no better then the offering of Swines bloud: Chriſt therefore, I ſay, once for all offered up a Sacrifice, which was himſelf, the virtue whereof was alwaies operative to make thoſe former Sacrifices effectual to thoſe ends and purpoſes before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and after that by his own bloud he entred into the Holy Place.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb</hi> 9 12.10, 12.</note>

                     <p>So then Chriſt it was that was ſtill repreſented as a ſlain man, in all thoſe Sacrifices of old; for a ſentence of Death lying upon him, through the determinate Counſel, and fore knowledge of God, made him in all thoſe Ages before,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Act.</hi> 2 23.</note> as good as dead, in which regard, he is called <hi>The Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world.</hi>

                           <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8.</note> And becauſe Juſtice would have Death for ſatisfaction, elſe muſt the whole World have immediately fallen under her diſpleaſure; therefore in all likely hood the very firſt thing that died in the World was Chriſt in a Figure, and conſequently a Sacrifice from the beginning</p>
                     <p>He was a Sacrifice ready even for <hi>Cain</hi> to make uſe of for his good, if he had had Faith to apply it, as appeareth by the words which the Lord ſpeaks unto him; <hi>If thou doeſt not well, ſin lieth at the door.</hi> That is,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7.</note> a Sacrifice for ſin, for ſo the offering for ſin is in Scripture frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called; which Interpretation becauſe it may carry with it a ſound of novelty,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Firſt, God cometh not to deject <hi>Cain</hi> lower then he was, but to raiſe him up from his dejection, as is manifeſt both by his deigning to give him an Oracle from Heaven, and alſo by the words wherewith he beginneth his ſpeech unto him, Why art thou wrath? and why is thy Countenance fallen?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If the words, <hi>Sin lieth at the door,</hi> intend a ſudden judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſeize upon him, what coherence can there be between theſe and the words following, which are ſpoken concerning <hi>Abel, viz. And thy brothers deſire ſhall be ſubject unto thee;</hi> For to read the place thus, <hi>If thou doeſt not well thou ſhalt certainly be puniſhed, and thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deſire ſhall be ſubject unto thee,</hi> This, if there be any coherence at all, were to threaten poor <hi>Abel</hi> more or at leaſt as much as <hi>Cain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Original word <hi>Chateath</hi> (it is the aforeſaid Authours obſervation) as it ſignifieth Sin, ſo alſo doth it the Sacrifice for Sin, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</note> do witneſs. And it was the cuſtom (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh, as being beſt acquainted therewith) to lay the Sacrifice at the Sanctuary door, <hi>

                     <p>This ſenſe therefore upon theſe Conſiderations may ſeem to be
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42108:104"/>very agreeable with the ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt in that place, ſo that a Sacrifice was ready for <hi>Cain</hi> at that time: and what Sacrifice was that but Chriſt the Lamb then ſlain, who alone taketh away the ſin of the World; and beſides it ſeemeth to be a ſacrifice diſtinct from that which <hi>Cain</hi> and his Brother had before offered unto God. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of this</p>
                     <p>And now to cloſe up this whole matter, it appearech clearly, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by all that hath been here ſaid, that Jeſus Chriſt was the Prophet, King, and Prieſt of his Church, Yeſterday as well as to Day. And that thereupon it followeth infalliby that he was the ſame Saviour to his people of old, as he is to us now under the Goſpel</p>
                     <p>A Difference notwithſtanding I confeſs there is in reſpect of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation and Manifeſtation of Chriſt unto them and us. He was <hi>Velatus in Veteri, Revelatus in Novo Teſtamento,</hi> veiled and ſhadowed in the Old Teſtament, revealed and exhibited in the New, there ſhewed unto the Fathers in Types, here manifeſted unto us in Truths, but yet the Same Chriſt both to them and us, it being no more to their Prejudice that Chriſt was not then actually Crucified, then it is unto us now that he is not ſtill hanging upon the Croſs: for the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Operation of his Merits in the inſtant juncture of his ſufferings ſpreadeth and expiates it ſelf round about, backwards and forwards, upwards and downwards, and as a Center extendeth its Virtue to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of the Circumference: ſo Chriſt being the Center of his Church, all round about him within the extent of that Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, have their dependance upon him, and are intereſſed in his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                     <p>Yeſterday did <hi>Job</hi> declare his Confidence in Jeſus Chriſt in terms of as certain and high Expectation of Salvation through him as any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever can now under the Goſpel <hi>Job.</hi> 19.25.<note place="margin">

By the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it was required that one Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42108:105"/>ſhould redeem the Inheritance of another that was in danger of an Alienation, who was alſo to be an Avenger of Bloud; for when a Man was ſlain, his Kinſman by right of Propinquity did purſue the Man ſlayer, to be Avenged of him, wont alſo to raiſe up Seed unto the Deceaſed Kinſman, who died without Iſſue. Now unto theſe Cuſtomes, it is probable <hi>Job</hi> doth allude in this ſpeech of his concerning his Redeemer; yet clear it is by the Context, that his Aim alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is at Jeſus Chriſt, in and through whom he expected all this to be really done unto him. And (let me add by the way) ſo it is done unto <hi>Job</hi> and all others that are ſpiritually allied unto Jeſus Chriſt; for that right of Paradiſe which was loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt our Kinſman hath redeemed and purchaſed again for us: Chriſt alſo is the Avenger of our bloud, for when that infernal theif had betrayed us unto death, Chriſt purſued him, and never left him, till he had Vindicated our Bloud upon him; He hath likewiſe raiſed us up a Holy Seed, which lay not in our power to do, being Dead in Law through Sins and Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſes.

                     <p>This was the Faith of Believers Yeſterday, who by a ſpiritual Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick (as the term <gap reason="foreign">

For as Faith gives a Nullity to things that are, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Miſeries and Mortality of this Life, making them to be as if they were not, according to the Apoſtles Word (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10) <hi>As dying,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10.</note> and yet behold we live, at chaſtned, and yet not killed, as ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, yet alway rejoycing, as poor, yet making many ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

He was to their Faith a Sacrifice Crucified from the beginning of the World, who was not indeed Crucified till the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the World. In them was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by the Prophet, <hi>He that believeth ſhall not make haſte;</hi> though they did earneſtly long for the Coming of the Meſſiah,<note place="margin">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42108:106"/>living comfortably upon that Diſpenſation of Grace, which God in his great Wiſdom and Mercy had appointed for them. Yea though the Law come forth in its time for the aggravating of Sin (which as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. is not of Faith) crying out unto all with a Loud and Terrible Voice, <hi>Do this, or you ſhall Die,</hi> yet for all that their Faith did not fail, neither was it made void by the Law, as the law was not afterwards made void by Faith; for according to their Faith, ſo was it done unto them. Chriſt the Mediatour they not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but relied upon according to the Tenour of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Chriſt as Mediatour did always appear for them, to guide them in their Way, and to guard them in their need, to grant them their Deſires, and to obtain grace with God in their behalf. This hath been largely proved before, and therefore we need not ſtand much upon it now.</p>
                     <p>I will onely add one inſtance more whereby we ſhall ſee the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Indulgence of the Almighty in that time of Yeſterday diſpenſed in and through Jeſus Chriſt the Mediatour towards a poor Creature, who was then Ambitious, as I may ſay, to have a Diſcovery made unto him of the glorious Preſence of God beyond the Capacity of his weak nature, and whereto a conſenting, according to his asking muſt undoubtedly have proved his inevitable ruine. This poor Creature was <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom I ſo call in compariſon of him, with whom he had then to do, though otherwiſe <hi>A man of God</hi>

I go not about to wreſt this excellent Scripture, by forcing upon it a ſenſe which may not agree with the minde of the Holy Ghoſt therein, That be far from me; what I have to ſay concerning it, I ſhall leave to the Judgement of the Wiſe and Godly.</p>
                     <p>Firſt I ſhall by the way take this for granted, becauſe it hath been already proved, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had to do with Jeſus Chriſt, as the reſt of the people had, while He and they were together in the Wilderneſs. And it muſt be confeſſed, that there was as much need of the help and interpoſition of a Mediatour in this matter that we are ſpeaking of, as in any thing els; which I ſay was in great Mercy diſpenſed unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> as is manifeſt.

                     <p>As for the Preparation which is mentioned in the three laſt Verſes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42108:107"/>of this thirty third Chapter the particulars thereof are very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>viz.</hi> concerning the place that is ſaid to be by the Lord,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ex.</hi> 33.21, 22, 23.</note> and the Lord's putting <hi>Moſes</hi> into the cleft of the Rock, and covering it with his Hand: which that we may the better underſtand, and ſee how ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite they are to our preſent purpoſe, it will be needful for us to take into Conſideration, that whole intercourſe between the Lord and <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> prayeth unto the Lord, V. 13. in theſe words, <hi>Shew me now thy Way?</hi> What is that? Thy Way, ſay ſome, that thou meaneſt to take with this people in bringing them to the Land which thou didſt promiſe to give unto their Fathers: I will not deny but that this might be in the minde of <hi>Moſes,</hi> now when the Lord was pleaſed to admit him into his preſence, becauſe he was ever zealous for the peoples good; But there are ſome Circumſtances which follow, that do incline me to another ſenſe, at leaſt to joyn another with this, both which may be allowed together, being not inconſiſtent each with other, but tending both to one and the ſame end. It ſeemeth unto me that <hi>Moſes</hi> here prayeth that the Lord would reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto him out of the Cloud, in ſome ſhape and form, as he might be viſible unto his bodily ſight, which he therefore calleth his Way, becauſe he had been wont to do ſo to the Patriarchs before him, whom he likewiſe knew by Name. And I do the rather conceive this to be the ſenſe, becauſe of the ground and reaſon of his deſire, which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him in the words following, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Shew me thy way that I may know thee, and that I may find grace in thy ſight.</hi> True it is the Lord promiſeth him immediately after this, that his Preſence ſhould go with him, as being an Anſwer to his requeſt in the behalf of the people, the neceſſity whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo urgeth and inſiſteth upon V. 15, 16. Yet doth the Lord give him a further Anſwer in the Words that follow V. 17. as to a thing ſomewhat differing from that which concerned the people, <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do this thing alſo that thou haſt ſpoken, for thou haſt found grace in my ſight, and I know thee by Name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now ſince the Lord had before conſented that his Preſence ſhould go along with him in the Conduct of the people, and that <hi>Moſes</hi> had given his Reſtipulation thereunto, reſting him fully ſatisfied with what the Lord had promiſed, to what purpoſe is this other Conſent now ſuperadded, and that with a note of difference from what had paſſed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42108:108"/>before, if it be not this which I have here declared, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord would according to his deſire Viſibly appear unto him out of the Cloud in a humane ſhape, as he had been accuſtomed to do to others whom he knew by Name? which ſenſe being admitted how clear will the Circumſtances following, that are preparatory to the great diſcovery of God in the next Chapter, be unto us, which otherwiſe will prove very intricate and obſcure? <hi>Behold</hi> ſaith the Lord <hi>there is a place by me, and thou ſhalt ſtand upon a Rock, and it ſhall come to paſs while my Glory paſseth by, that I will put the in a Cleft of the Rock.</hi> Now what place upon Earth can be ſaid to be neerer to the Lord then another, ſeeing he filleth Heaven and Earth with his preſence? And what Rock, or Cleft of a Rock could be able to ſecure <hi>Moſes</hi> from the danger of being conſumed by that excellent Glory, which did appear, ſeeing the Rocks are cloven to pieces,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.6.</note> and thrown down before him?</p>
                     <p>How then could theſe things be? It is in vain now to produce an Anthropopathy, and ſo ſtretch it ſo far as to make it level with every Circumſtance; for doubtleſs there was a Reality in this matter, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular of it was done and effected to <hi>Moſes</hi> ſenſe, and to the full ſatisfaction of his expectation; ſo far as might ſtand with the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Life. Granting therefore that Jeſus Chriſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Man, there might then be a place ſaid to be, according to the ordinary courſe of Nature, neerer to him in that Mount, where the Lord was wont to meet this his ſervant, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elſewhere; he might alſo put <hi>Moſes</hi> into the Rock, and cover him with his Hand, to preſerve him from the imminent Danger, and then take away his Hand, that ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> might ſee ſome glimpſe of that Glory that paſſed by. Yea more, it is ſaid <hi>Exod</hi> 34.5. that <hi>the Lord Deſcended in a Cloud, and ſtood with him there, and proclaimed the Name of the Lord,</hi> and yet in the ſixth verſe it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord paſſed by before him, and proclaimed;</hi> to ſtand ſtill with <hi>Moſes</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming and to paſs by before him proclaiming too, ſeemeth in reaſon not to hold well together: the true meaning therefore undoubtedly is this, Jeſus Chriſt, who is Jehovah the Mediatour, came down upon the Mount in a Cloud, and then after he was deſcended, appears vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> according to his former Promiſe, and ſtood with him there to protect him from Danger, while Jehovah that is God the Father who is eſſentially one with the Son, paſſed by in his Glory, proclaiming his Name. To ſay nothing of the Lord's ſtay and abode
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42108:108"/>with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his converſe with him, as it is at large declared in the following part of the Chapter,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ex.</hi> 34 28.</note> and that for fourty days and fourty nights, as appears V. 28. after the end of this glorious Viſion; which did alſo put a glorious luſtre upon the face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which never any of God's former appearances unto him did, It is I ſuppoſe manifeſt unto all men, that this preparation that was here made, doth demonſtrate clearly that Jeſus Chriſt was a mediatour to <hi>Moſes</hi> for good, and that without him he could never have been able with ſafety to his Life to have endured that excellent glory.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The form or method of that divine Proclamation doth alſo intimate the ſame unto us. Let us conſider it ſo far as I conceive for the preſent it hath a pertinency to the point in hand, and that is in the order and method of the Names wherewith the God proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, <hi>viz. The Lord, the Lord God.</hi> Obſerve firſt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ex.</hi> 34.6.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lord,</hi> then <hi>The Lord God,</hi> The firſt implying one that hath his Being of himſelf, and who is the Authour of all ſubordinate Beings; the ſecond ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, the Lord Strong and Mighty: The firſt ſheweth Goodneſs, the ſecond, Greatneſs: The firſt, puts the Creature into a relation unto God, and gives it a dependance upon him,<note place="margin">Ex. <hi>6.3.</hi> Note <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods preſence were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, poſsibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was then to be Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the renewed Covenant of Works wherein Jeſus Chriſt was not to be concerned.</note> the ſecond advanceth the Divine excellency above the Creature, and beyond the deſcent of a Correlation unto it: in a Word, The firſt conferres a Right upon Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to and in the Mediatour (for it is Jehovah that gives a being to all the Promiſes <hi>Exod</hi> 6.3.) the ſecond makes the Mediatour himſelf-ſubordinate unto God.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore, behold the Goodneſs of God preſented unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in that <hi>The Lord</hi> is named before <hi>The Lord God:</hi> had this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of the name of God been without this preceeding Title, I doubt it had not been ſafe for <hi>Moſes</hi> to have ſeen any glimpſe of all that tranſient Glory, ſuch as never was the like manifeſted unto him, or any other mortal man before: and if ſo, what can this argue but the neceſſity of a Mediatour between God and man, without whom never could any of the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> ſince the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was defiled by his Disobedience have the leaſt Acquaintance with the Almighty to their Comfort, but muſt for ever have been kept at a diſtance from him. But it is the Lord that is between <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Lord God, which makes all that God ſaith of himſelf to be very good.</p>
                     <p>And now I do here humbly commend this Interpretation which I have given of this place of Scripture to the whole Church of God,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42108:109"/>being partly led thereunto by the conſideration of the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (which alſo is obſervable) of the Scriptures ſpeaking of God before the expulſion of our firſt Parents out of Paradiſe, where the promiſe of Grace was given unto them immediately upon their Fall, from that which is ſpoken of him afterwards; before, <hi>viz.</hi> In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third Chapters of <hi>Geneſis, Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of God with the Appellative Title of <hi>The Lord God,</hi> but after in the fourth Chapter, and ſo forwards he maketh mention of <hi>the Lord</hi> onely, not <hi>The Lord God:</hi> which to my apprehenſion doth plainly imply, that God did not appear unto Man after the Fall, as he did before; but what inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſoever paſſed between God and Man, was in and through the Mediation of Jehovah, that is, Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord: Not but the Father and the Holy Ghoſt are called in Scripture Jehovah too, even as the Son (ſee <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5.) But whereſoever theſe two Titles,<note place="margin">Jehovah Jehovah El.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lord,</hi> and <hi>The Lord God</hi> are ſet together and diſtinguiſht each from other (as in that to <hi>Moſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, and in this latter mentioned by <hi>Moſes</hi> (there is the Son onely <hi>Quatenus</hi> Mediatour to be underſtood by it.</p>
                     <p>Clearly then Jeſus Chriſt was the Mediatour Yeſterday between God and his people, as well as to Day. And upon the whole it is manifeſt that he was <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, the Same, or the onely He to his Church in point of Salvation under the Old Teſtament, even as now under the New. And let this ſuffice for the Confirmation of this Doctrine. But as we have proved the Truth of it, ſo it is very fit that we ſhould now improve it in making ſome Uſe thereof for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, I ſhall again take this opportunity to make an Addreſs to the diſperſed of the Jews, whom I do beſeech by all that antient Love that hath been between God and them, that they would yet look upon him whom they have pierced.

And I beſeech you, will it not be far better for you, that the Prophet's words ſhould be made good in this Generation, then in thoſe that come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you? Look upon your preſent eſtate wherein you ſtand, and ſee whether that honourable Bloud of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt which your
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42108:109"/>Fathers ſhed, do not lie upon you as a ſtupendious guilt unto this very Day. Look upon all that is written by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, and ſee whether it be not all exactly fulfilled to a Tittle in that our bleſſed Lord, who on Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> by <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was with wicked hands crucified and ſlain. Nay, have not your ſelves been inſtrumental in executing that upon Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which was prophecyed ſhould be done unto the Meſſiah? Alas, alas, will you be ſtill wilfully blinde? look up and behold your King! Pilate once ſpake it in ſcorn, or out of a Deſign of Rebellion againſt <hi>Caeſar;</hi>

                           <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.14</note> but I ſpeak it unto you, as I ſaid before, out of a hearty deſire of your Reſtauration to your former Glory: Behold I ſay your King, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your Prieſt, and behold your Prophet; Your King, who watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over you in all your Generations of old, to defend and protect you, and to deliver you from all your Enemies, and whom now alſo to ſerve, you will undoubtedly finde to be your perfect freedom; Your Prieſt, whoſe Sacrifice did virtually accompany all the Sacrifices of the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Prieſt-hood, making them effectual for your Good, and will fully expiate your great ſin in ſacrificing, that is, Crucifying even this your High-Prieſt, who is now in the Holy place, at the right hand of his Father, making interceſſion for you; Your Prophet, who gave unto your Fathers Statutes and Judgements, ſo righteous, that there was no Nation how great ſo ever in this World that had the like, and who will now again teach you the good and the right way, if you will hearken unto him.</p>
                     <p>Awake, Awake therefore O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> awake awake, gather your ſelves together, yea, gather your ſelves together, O Nation that art to be deſired, behold and ſee how tenderly careful the Lord hath been of you, ever ſince he took you to be his peculiar people: Time was when he carried you about as upon Eagle's wings, and the time is now come, that he would take yee into his Boſome, wherein alone you ſhall after all your unkindneſses finde reſt for your Souls. He remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the kindneſs of your Youth, O that you would now conſider the kindneſs of his Age! Fortie years long did your Fathers greive him in the wilderneſs, and will you go on to vex him fortie times forty more? He then ſwore in his wrath that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, and accordingly it came to paſs; for their Carcaſſes all fell in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, but their little ones which they ſaid ſhould be a prey, them did he bring into that Good Land, which he promised to give unto

                        <hi>Abraham:</hi> be warned therefore betimes, for if you will not turn, you ſhall certainly fall and periſh, as they did, but your Children ſhall ſurely ſee that Glory that ſhall be revealed, for the Lord hath ſworn in his Love, that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall not be forſaken for ever. Conſider it is no novelty that we perſwade you unto, but that which was from the the beginning, which we have heard, which we have ſeen with our Eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the Word of Life (for the Life was manifeſted, and we have ſeen it, and bear Witneſs, and ſhew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifeſted unto us) that which we have ſeen and heard declare we unto you, that yee alſo may have Fellowſhip with us, and truely our Fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt. Come then, I ſay, again, and mourn for him whom you have pierced, and we alſo will mourn with you; for good cauſe have we ſo to do, having alas many a time dealt too treacherouſly with this our great redeemer, and put him to an open ſhame by our frequent ſwerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and tergiverſations from that righteous and holy rule that he hath ſet us; we will abandon this preſent evil World, and all the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering inſinuations thereof: our deareſt relations ſhall be of no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue with us in compariſon of our fellowſhip with you, and that Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Covenant which ſhall oblige us both unto our common Lord, who hath loved you from the beginning, and will love you again more abundantly, if you will now turn unto him. Return, return there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore O <hi>Shulamite,</hi> return, return.</p>
                     <p>Secondly this may teach us to forbear that Diſdain which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly found to be in theſe days againſt the Ages that have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; For, whatſoever Light hath been in the World at any time, it hath been derived from this Father of Lights, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And he hath by that tender care which himſelf had both of the Law, and the Fathers who lived under it and before it, ſet us an Example to bear a due reſpect as becommeth Brethren to that antiquity, which hath been enlightned by him in this Day of the Goſpel. For the Law, though it was perverted, by ſuch as would not believe in him, to a Siniſter uſe, even to the utter Abolition of his whole Evangelical inſtitute, and was in that reſpect juſtly diſavowed by his Apoſtles in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; yet he profeſſeth the deſign of his coming was not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it. And for the Fathers in their ſundry Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42108:110"/>before him, who walking in this Light had fellowſhip with him, we have ſufficiently ſeen how he hath owned them. Yea and ever ſince he hath been the leader and ſupporter of his Church in all the various changes that have come upon it, for he is he <hi>Everlaſting Father</hi> of his people <hi>Eſ.</hi> 9.6. and the Proviſion, whatſoever it was, that his family hath hitherto lived upon from the time that he dwelt among us, as it hath been as his coſt, and of his wiſe and prudent deviſing, ſo it hath been always ordered and diſpoſed by him. How ill then doth it become us, in theſe days to caſt forth reproachful ſpeeches againſt the Light of antiquity, or thoſe that walked in it? Do we not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by call into queſtion the Wiſdom of Chriſt himſelf?</p>
                     <p>I ſpeak not here of the unwritten Verities or Traditions of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity (as they are called) which have neither with them a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Recognition, nor any warrant or footſtep from the written word (That is a Door which hath let in much Corruption into the Church) nor of the untrue writings of any Monkiſh Heterodox Spirits, which are the ſpurious Iſſue of that man of Sin: But that which I do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take upon this occaſion to vindicate, is that Holy, Venerable, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, Orthodox Antiquity which hath been alwayes faithful to Jeſus Chriſt and his Goſpel, which hath borne the burden and heat of the day in maintaining and defending by Writing, by Preaching by Living, by Dying, the Doctrine of Chriſt crucified againſt the Prince of Darkneſs, and all his curſed Adherents.</p>
                     <p>What though there have been clouds and eclipſes of the glorious Light of Truth in former times (which notwithſtanding have by the brightneſs of Chriſts appearance in the Miniſtery of his old Servants been diſpelled, ſcattered and removed.) What though there have been Differences and Contentions ariſen rather about Circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als then Fundamentals of the Goſpel (from which we in this Age are not altogether free) Yet ſince it is ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt hath been the ſame to them which he is to us, we ſhould learn to judge at leaſt more modeſtly then we do of the dayes that have been before us. It is, as it hath been obſerved, the common diſeaſe of all Ages to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud themſelves above any that have been before them; Actions of men being for the moſt part according to the vogue and ſway of times, and have onely their upholding by the opinion of the vulgar. We deale with Antiquity but as Poſterity will with us, which ever thinks it ſelf the wiſer, and that will judge likewiſe of our errours according
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42108:111"/>to the Caſt of their Imaginations. Yet I ſay not but that we have great reaſon to bleſs God for thoſe diſcoveries of his Grace, and thoſe Manifeſtations of his Truth that wee enjoy in theſe times, and I doubt not but God hath ſome alſo now that will be valiant for his Truth, as there have been ever of old; but when we look into the Lives of thoſe who now-a-dayes are moſt zealous in decrying Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and extolling the preſent Age, and yet finde Spiritual Pride and Cenſoriouſneſs ſo common amongſt them, beſides their Intemperance, Uncharitableneſs, Covetouſneſs, Uncleanneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſhould not be once named without Horrour among Saints, what ſhall we then ſay, but that we are too much infected with a Laodicean Temper, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting our ſelves to be rich and increaſing in goods, and have need of nothing, when indeed we are wretched and miſerable and poor and blind and naked. We make our boaſt often of the great knowledge and underſtanding that we have in the myſtery of the Goſpel above all others that have been before us, and that we are as Children ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſhoulders of Giants, and therefore we can ſee further then they (a childiſh Conceit and an abſurd Crotchet wherewith many pleaſe themſelves, being ready to ſay not from the Humble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, but from a ſtrong opinion of their own weakneſs, and a weaker Judgment of the ſtrength of others, we are wiſer then our Teachers, we have more underſtanding then the Antient ever had) but can they, or any elſe tell us what Holineſs there is more now, then there hath been in the Saints of old? What Brotherly Love? What zeal for the Truth? what contempt of the World? what mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of inward Luſts and crucifying of the Fleſh with the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, is now to be ſeen in this Generation more then hath been formerly? If we know more then others that have been before us, and yet come ſhort of them in the power of Religion what a ſhame is it?<note place="margin">
                           <hi>At Saint</hi> Margarets Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> It was an ingenuous Confeſſion made by one of late times in their greateſt Aſſemby, though he miſtook in his Paralel <hi>We were beſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in worſt times, we held our Cloak in the winde and now are laying it off in the Sun. A miſerable declination from the Life and Power of Godlineſs is come to paſs within theſe few years: our practicals, our inward and cloſe ways of walking with God in Faith and Love are ſublim'd into fancies, and vapour out into Fumes of new opinions, and which is worſt of all, we take this Dropſie to be growth, and conceive our ſelves to be more ſpiritual and refin'd, becauſe more Aiery and Notional.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42108:111"/>The Lord humble us for our declenſions and ſwervings from the end of the Commandment, which is Love out of a pure Heart, and of a good Conſcience and Faith unfained, and for our turnings aſide to vain Janglings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now if the example of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as it hath been before preſented unto us, together with his immutable conſtancy in being ſtill the Same in the Diſpenſation of his Goſpel, it being never yet wholly retracted ſince it was firſt made known unto the World (for it was once and but once delivered unto the Saints) will not move us to give a due Veneration to the Holy Antients and Fathers that have gone before us, who have been partakers with us of the ſame precious Faith, and have laboured with indefatigable pains in the Lord's Vine-yard, their workes praiſing them in the gates, let the conſciouſneſs of our own unworthineſs under that glorious Light, unto which we do pretend, perſwade us thereunto.</p>
                     <p>But if any ſhall ſay <hi>quorſum haec?</hi> To what purpoſe is all this ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs about antiquity? I may anſwer, Is there not a cauſe, when the Glory of Chriſt is diminiſhed by our detraction from it, and when a common violence is done to the Holy Scripture in limiting the Accompliſhment of ſundry Prophecies to theſe times, and thoſe that come after us? It being moſt certain they have been already fulfilled, even in thoſe elder days of the Goſpel, that are made of ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckoning by us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This may ſerve to ſatisfie all the World that the Religion which we profeſs is the onely true Religion; we I ſay that have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from <hi>Rome,</hi> as it now ſtandeth, or rather as it is fallen from what it was before that depraved and deplorable Corruption which it hath contracted by the intruſion of many and ſundry ſuperſtitions upon it through the ſubtlety of Satan, and the cunning craſtineſs of men of corrupt minds, who have ſought themſelves and their own intereſts more then the things of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>If Antiquity muſt needs be a mark of a true Church, then can we make our boaſt of it as much as any. <hi>The rock of Ages</hi> is our foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and the gates of Hell ſhall never drive us from it. We diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to hold of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> or any man els how eminent ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he might be for Piety in his Generation. A tenure indeed that the recent Conventicle of <hi>Rome</hi> hath deviſed, which becauſe it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to <hi>Peter</hi> as its Founder and Authour Paramount, will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42108:112"/>obtrude upon others the like Weak and Upſtart originals, and if they cannot compare with them (as they conceive) in ſuch a Claim, they are ready to cry them down for Noveliſts and intruders as utterly unworthy to have any ſociety with the Churches of Chriſt. But far be it from us to build upon any ſuch foundations; And for any Novelty in our Profeſſion, as concerning the ſubſtance of Religion, we can maintain it againſt the World, that we are in no wiſe Guilty thereof.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be acknowledged on all ſides that the old way is the onely right way, and that that is moſt conſonant to Truth, which is of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Antiquity. But then the Queſtion will be, where our Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhall begin? Surely it muſt not be at ſome Centuries of years that have been lately before us; but rather we are to look for the firſt beginning of this way, from the beginning of the World, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will not in this ſenſe Merit the Title of Antiquity, but that Goſpel exception will be of force againſt it, <hi>Non fuit ſic ab initio,</hi>

                        <hi>It was not ſo from the Beginning.</hi> A ſingular and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gradation of the riſe and progreſs of Truth, is that which is given by a certain Antient, <hi>Id verius quod prius, id prius quod ab initio, id ab initio quod à Deo,</hi> That is trueſt which was firſt, that which was firſt is from the beginning, that which was from the beginning was of God.

If we vary from others in outward formes, or if there be variances amongſt our ſelves about them (as alas there are too many, the more is the Pity, and when was there a people of God conſtituted into a Church that were wholly free) yet this will not conclude us to have taken up a new Religion, no more then the ſeveral Faſhions in our Attire do deprive us of the antient Priviledges of our Country, and make us another Nation.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42108:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>confinement for the Souls of the Faithful, who lived and died Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in that long tract of time under the Law, and before it, which place is by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> called <hi>Limbus Patrum;</hi> for in regard the work of Redemption was not fully accompliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt, till he had ſuffered Death upon the Croſs, therefore ſay they, all thoſe Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs and Prophets, and Holy men of old from the beginning of the World unto that time, could not enter into Heaven, but were ſhut up in ſome lower parts of the Earth, bordering upon Purgatory, which ſay they is next door to Hell. For (ſaith Biſhop <hi>Mountague</hi>) as if ſome of their Maſters had been ſoon ſent thither to take a ſurvey thereof, they do quarter out that infernal Clime into four Regions; And this place amongſt the reſt, which they have aſſigned unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they determine to be the uppermoſt Fringe, as the Word <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> ſignifies, or the verge of Hell. It is not my purpoſe to deſcend ſo low as to examine the particulars of this their Subterraneous Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rography. I believe the Vanity thereof is Viſible enough to all that have not their Eyes put out with the ſmoke of Purgatory. Rather let the ſtrength of our preſent Doctrine be ſet in oppoſition to this fond dream of that falſe and <hi>Apoſtatical</hi> Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath obtruded many ſuch like idle Fopperies upon thoſe poor people that are bewitched with her Sorceries, and then let all mankinde judge w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the Truth True it is,<note place="margin">

Where we may ſee, that that City having Foundations, which the Holy Patriarch by Faith expected, is by an Antitheſis ſet <hi>ad oppoſitum</hi> to thoſe Tabernacles, which he formerly lived in with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> whereby is intimated that he was not received into any other building after his death, then that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.

Moreover (becauſe this Parable is much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to their ſiniſter ſenſe) when <hi>Abraham</hi> oppoſeth <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Comfort to the Glutton's Torment, it is evident that he being in infinite Torment, the other was in infinite Joy; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot be but in Heaven,<note place="margin">A term ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt to the Ages of the Church before Chriſt.

We are not to be regulated by the Opinions of Men in this matter, whether Antient or Modern, though in ſome other points that are not of ſo great concernment we may happily afford a willing compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy: In this caſe we will call no man Father upon Earth, for one is our Father, which is in Heaven; To the Law therefore, and to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, whoſoever ſpeaks not according to this Word, in Order to Chriſt's Glory, and the Salvation of his Church, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</p>
                     <p>And now when I was even about to leave this point, ſo to proceed unto that which followeth; I have met with a ſpoke in my way upon which I muſt ſtop a little, being well aſſured notwithſtanding, that my Text will bear down all Oppoſition that may be raiſed againſt it.</p>
                     <p>There have been we know in theſe late times certain ſtrange Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42108:114"/>ſcattered about, ſuch as have been of pernicious conſequence to Religion, And if amongſt the reſt I meet with any which ſtrike at the Honour of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which our preſent Text aſcribeth unto him, I hope I may take liberty to bear Witneſs againſt them, of how great Name ſoever the Authours thereof may be that have maintained them. I ſhall forbear to nominate any Perſons, but doe heartily wiſh, they would ſeriouſly conſider with themſelves, how they may for the Church's ſake, retract that which they have of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo unadviſedly written.</p>
                     <p>It hath been maintained and publiſhed by one Authour eſpecially of great and eminent Note, That the Object of the faith of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and Fathers of old, was not <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Mediatour, but God alone, that is, God the Father, And that ſuch efficacy as the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſacrifices of the Law had, was not ſo much in reference to the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be made of Chriſt, as extrinſecal and affixed by the Divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and inſtitution of Almighty God: Yea, that the very Heathen did in thoſe times without Chriſt, even by the light of Nature attain unto ſuch a Knowledge of God as was enough for their everlaſting Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That theſe Cockatrice Eggs were hatched by Hereticks of old is well known, The Church was much peſtred with theſe <hi>Pelagian</hi> vermine in former times; But that after they have been cruſhed with the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of Divine truth in the hands of Holy Antients and Servants of Chriſt of late, that they ſhould I ſay be now, brought to Light again, perking up with ſuch boldneſs as they do, and that among us in this Church, who have been taught by terrible things in righteouſneſs to ſet up and adore the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Throne, It is and will be ſurely too great a provocation of God's jealouſie againſt us. Having therefore mett with ſuch Aſſertions as theſe, ſo deſtructive to the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the times, and ſo diametrically contrary to the Doctrine that hath been inſiſted upon, being derogatory to the Merits of the Lord Jeſus, making them uſeleſs to the World before the time of his coming, I conceive a neceſſity is laid upon me to proteſt againſt them.</p>
                     <p>It hath been the great deſign of Satan at all times to bring the world to be as little beholding to Chriſt, as may be; and to that purpoſe hath he bewitched men with ſtrong deluſions, one while ſuggeſting to their minds prejudicate opinions concerning the ways of Chriſt, that they are greivous, unprofitable and unreaſonable ways, another while
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42108:115"/>infuſing into them Principles of ſelf-ſufficiency, that ſo long as they have materials enough of their own to finiſh their building, what need they go to ſeek in another's Quarry: ſometimes perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that the Saints in Heaven muſt be his Coadjutours in office, to obtain grace for his people here, and to help them in time of need; again making them believe that after this Life is ended, their ſouls muſt lie down in Purgatory for a time, before they can be carried up into Heaven. And why is all this, and much more attempted by this grand Adverſary the Devil? but becauſe, as I ſaid, he would draw men to have as little dependance upon Chriſt as poſſibly he can; and conſequently, that he might by degrees totally eclipſe the glory of the Lord Jeſus (for he hates him with a perfect hatred) and utterly fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in the end the great work of Redemption.</p>
                     <p>From this Forge it is (I doubt not to ſay it) that this old Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme now newly revived, concerning the needleſneſs of the Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt under the Law, hath had its forming and contrivance, wherein ſome of late have exceeded above meaſure. It would be too tedious here to interſert all that is written of this matter in a Book called <hi>Theologia Veterum,</hi> and to give anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; this onely would I know, how the Lord Jeſus could <hi>Quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Mediatour be <gap reason="foreign">

Doubtleſs there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be truth in both theſe aſſertions: and if any ſhall aſſert Doctrines contrary to the expreſs Word of Scripture, whether it is better to hearken to the Holy Ghoſt, or them, judge you. But I ſhall leave this matter to their ſecond thoughts, who have been too raſh in ſpreading about theſe Anti-ſcriptural Paradoxes, hoping that thoſe who continue ſtill too pragmatically Active therein will now find Cauſe to repent them betimes of their errour and retract it.</p>
                     <p>Onely I muſt here add, if this Errour be to be repented of, how much more that other which is made the ground of it, and which doth indeed ſnatch the Crown off from the head of Chriſt, not ſuffering him to have any thing to do at all in the ſalvation of his people from the beginning of the World to the end thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That God was pleaſed to make choice, not of the Object, but the Act of faith, The T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But as the Holy Martyr ſaid of old, <hi>in retam ſancta Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratio non habet locum,</hi> When ſuch affronts as theſe are put upon the Almighty God, we muſt not be mealy-mouthed; how dares any man utter ſuch a notorious untruth as this, <hi>God was not pleaſed to make choice of the Object of Faith for our Juſtification?</hi> If an Angel from Heaven ſhould come and preach this Doctrine we ſhould ſpit in his face, and hold him accurſed: Can there be any thing in this world dearer to us then this, that the Lord is our Righteouſneſs?

A power is given unto Miniſters of the Goſpel in many places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſuch as properly belongeth unto God himſelf, and his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, As for example, the works of Regeneration, Converſion, Remiſſion of Sins, everlaſting Salvation: what are all theſe but works far beyond the reach of man or Angel, being ſuch as hath been ſaid belong unto God and Chriſt, yet we know all theſe are by the Goſpel aſcribed unto Miniſters:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Joh</hi> 20.23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.</note> for they are ſaid <hi>to beget men unto God,</hi> as alſo <hi>to convert them, opening their eyes, turning them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God, to remit their Sins, yea to ſave them:</hi> but now becauſe theſe things are ſpoken of Miniſters in a way of ſubſerviency unto Jeſus Chriſt, will any man be ſo void of reaſon therefore, as to exclude Chriſt himſelf, and ſay, not Chriſt, but Miniſters do regenerate, convert, forgive, and ſave thoſe that do believe? Yet thus do our adverſaries argue in this caſe, becauſe it is ſaid, faith is counted for righteouſneſs, and we are juſtified by faith, therefore hath God made choice not of the Object, but the Act of faith to be imputed to us for our Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>There is indeed a lenitive caſt in to qualifie the ſharpneſs of this corroding and poiſonous errour, graunting faith not to be the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe of Juſtification. But why then is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Object of our faith ſo plainly ſhut out from having any part at all in this matter? and why are we told that where it is ſaid, we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, it is not to be taken Tropically and Metonymically for the Object, as many Orthodox Writers do interpret it, whom I could ſet in oppoſition to thoſe that are muſtered up for the defenſe of this
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42108:116"/>Errour (if they have at leaſt given that ſuffrage unto it as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) yea, and why is ſuch an inference derived from the Apoſtles fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent magnifying of faith (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.) as to ſay, the Holy Ghoſt had not bound himſelf ſo preciſely to thoſe words and ſyllables (<hi>viz.</hi> of juſtification by faith) if he had not meant to give this Honour unto faith it ſelf, but rather to ſome other thing (as it is moſt uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called) which faith laieth hold upon?</p>
                     <p>Alaſs, alaſs, that any who pretend to have a ſhare in the merits of Chriſt, ſhould in this manner detract from his Glory? did the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf <hi>Bear our ſins in his own body on the Tree,</hi> yea, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſin for us</hi> that his righteouſneſs might be imputed unto us, and according to the appointment of his Father, be made glorious in our juſtification, and ſhall not the travel of his Soul be his peculiar ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? what, is faith it ſelf become falſe to the juſtling of Chriſt out of his Throne, whoſe office it is, and ever hath been, to advance and promote his Crown and Dignity? or rather, is not the hand of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab,</hi> I meane, the malice of the Devil, as I ſaid before, evidently to be ſeen going along in this matter? In vain it is for any man living to make a flouriſh, and to boaſt of a conſtant adherency to the Proteſtant Profeſſion, notwithſtanding the fury of late perſecutions, when there is ſuch a manifeſt agreement avouched with <hi>Rome</hi> in this particular, <hi>viz.</hi> of juſtification by works;<note place="margin">It ſeems by common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Book called <hi>Theologia Veterum,</hi> is of late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs what is here written, may ſtand as an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve others from the infection of theſe poſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent errours</note> which if there were nothing elſe to work in the hearts of thoſe that are faithful to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, a loathing of that Anti-chriſtian Synagogue this alone were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cauſe an everlaſting ſeparation.</p>

                  <p>The text we ſee calleth it a day, and it is light we know that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Day, without which it vaniſheth and cometh to nothing. A Day then it is, and a light-ſome day. A day which the Lord hath made, even the Lord our Light, and our Righteouſneſs, the Path of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42108:117"/>that juſt one, having from the beginning been as the ſhining light that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day. A glorious day, wherein is concluded the light of Yeſterday: For as the light which for the three firſt dayes of the Creation was diſperſed through the Heavens, it pleaſed God to gather and unite into one body of the Sun; ſo that Light of Yeſterday which was diffuſed through ſo many ſhadowes, and Legal Ceremonies was at laſt complicated and folded up in Chriſt the Son of Righteouſneſs, who is now in this day of his Power like a ſtrong man running his Race, diſplaying his Beames, diſtilling his Influences, filling the Earth with knowledge, even as the Waters covers the Seas. But let us more particularly behold and ſee the Glory of this Light.</p>
                  <p>Firſt the Light of this Day is <hi>the true Light,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.8.</note> as the Evangeliſt Saint <hi>John</hi> calleth it 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.8. Not like unto that of old, which was darkned with the ſhadowes of the Moſaicall Oeconomy, but clear and manifeſt, <hi>Lumen illuminans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh</hi> 1.9.</note> 
                     <hi>A Light that inlightneth every man that cometh into the World, non illuminatum,</hi> not inlightned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any man in the World.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a great Light, overſpreading the whole World, ſhining out into all Nations, making a day of Salvation unto all People. There were two great Lights which God Created in the beginning, the greater Light to rule the Day,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.16.</note> and the leſſer Light to rule the Night: Anſwerably hereunto hath God ordained two great Lights for his Church, the leſſer Light to rule the time of the Law, and the greater to rule the time of the Goſpel; and as the Evening did precede the Morning, in the ordering of the natural Day, ſo was the Law before the Goſpel in Reference unto this Day. When therefore the Night is ſpent, and the Day come, we may conclude that a great Light, greater then what was before hath appeared in the World; and as it was foretold, ſo can we ſay, It is fulfilled, <hi>The People that walked in Darkneſs have ſeen a great Light,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſ.</hi> 9.2.</note> 
                     <hi>they that dwell in the Land of the ſhadow of death, upon them hath the Light ſhined;</hi> ſo then it is a great Light.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is likewiſe a <hi>marvellous Light,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.</note> Leading its followers into a <hi>knowledge that paſſeth knowledge</hi> either Humane or Angelicall. (So Zanchy interprets the Place <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19.) Revealing ſuch <hi>things which Eye never ſaw, nor Eare ever heard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 29.</note> 
                     <hi>nor could have entred into any heart to conceive.</hi> Marvellous to the Bleſſed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42108:118"/>Angels, whoſe Glory and Crown though it be to be Angels of Light alwayes beholding the face of God in Heaven, yet perceiving a Light here alſo in this Day of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10.</note> whereby they might come to have more experience of the manifold Wiſdome of God, they are ſaid with much greedineſs of Speculation, <hi>to ſtoop down,</hi> and to gaze upon it. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous to the Children of the Day, who are on all ſides filled with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the glorious appearance of that ſhining Light, which they conſtantly behold in the diſpenſations of Grace, and wherein they conceive themſelves ten thouſand times happier, then if they had the Glory of the world laid at their feet. Marvellous alſo to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this World, it being the Aſtoniſhment of Nations, that all their Projects and Attempts to put out the Light of this Day have ever been fruſtrated, and blown away like the Spiders web; for loe the powers of the Earth, and the Gates of Hell were Aſſembled, they paſſed by together, they ſaw it, and ſo they marvelled, they were troubled and haſted away <hi>Pſ.</hi> 48.4.5.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 48.4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Veniunt, vident, &amp; vaneſcunt,</hi> they come and ſee and vaniſh together.</p>
                  <p>Yea fourthly ſo invincible is the light of this day, that all the powers of darkneſs ſhall never be able to extinguiſh it. To illuſtrate this particular let us take into conſideration the invincible nature of that light whatſoever it is, which God who is the Authour of Lights hath ſet up among the Creatures in this World: And to this purpoſe give me leave to interſert a very pithy and pertinent Meditation of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous Authour that I have met with in a late Writer which may lead us farther into the knowledge of the Light of this day, we ſee and prove ſaith he by dayly Experience how powerfull and dreadfull a thing the darkneſs of the Night is, for when it falleth, it covereth and muffleth up the face of the whole World, it obſcureth and hideth the hue and faſhion of all Creatures, it bindeth up all hands, and breaketh off all employments, it arreſteth and keepeth Captive all living Wights, Men and Beaſts, that they muſt be ſtill and reſt there where it arreſteth them; yea, it maketh them fearfull and faint-hearted, full of fancies, and much ſubject to frights; It is of all other ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and unconquerable Tyrant, as no man is able to withſtand: And yet nevertheleſs it is not of that Might that it is able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme or to quench the leaſt Light in the World: For we ſee that the darker the Night is, the clearer the Stars ſhine; yea, the leaſt Candles-light that is lighted, withſtandeth the whole Night, and not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42108:118"/>only ſuffereth not the darkneſs to cover or to ſmother and oppreſs it, but it giveth Light alſo even in the midſt of the Darkneſs, and beate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h it back for ſome ſpace and diſtance on every ſide of it: So that which way ſoever it is borne, or whereſoever it cometh, there muſt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depart, and give place unto Light, all the power and dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it cannot help or prevaile ought againſt it: And though the Light be ſo weake, that it cannot caſt Light far about, or drive the Darkneſs far from it, as in the ſparkle of an hot Coale; yet cannot the the Darkneſs cover or conceale, and much leſs quench it, but it giveth light to it ſelf alone at leaſt ſo that it may be ſeen afar off in the darke, and it remaineth unconquered of the dark, though it cannot help o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, nor give light unto them. Yea (that that is yet more wonderful) a rotten ſhining piece of wood which hath the fainteſt light that can be found, yet remaineth invincible of all the power of darkneſs, and the more it is compaſſed about with darkneſs, the clearer light it giveth; ſo little is darkneſs able to overcome or keep down any light, but that it ruleth and vanquiſheth and expelleth the darkneſs, which elſe overwhelmeth, and ſnareth, and fettereth, and putteth all things in fear. Now if this natural light be ſo powerful, and ſo able to prevail againſt the darkneſs of the night, why ſhould not the glorious light which now ſhineth in this day of the Goſpel continue ſtill in its Brightneſs, notwithſtanding all the attempts that are made by the Prince of Darkneſs and his Adherents to put it out? Continue doubtleſs it ſhall, and remain invincible to the end of the World. Yea, according to that meaſure and proportion of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of errour, which in ſundry Generations is raiſed up to obſcure and deface it, It ſhall certainly encreaſe into a greater Glory. And though this may carry with it the ſound of a paradox in the ears of ſome people unacquainted with the ways of God, yet it will be found to be a moſt certain truth, becauſe this day of the Goſpel is not a day of ſmall things, of things to be deſpiſed, of things eaſy to be reduced to a non-entity, as if they never had been, ſuch as the deſignes of Men oftentimes to their ſhame prove to be; but excellent things they are, ſurpaſſing the comprehenſions of Angels, which are the fruit and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of this day, even the <hi>Arcana Coeli, &amp; Magnalia Dei,</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Heaven, and the great things of God, things which many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and righteous men in the generations of old have deſired to ſee, but could not, are now clearly made known to the Church in this day
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42108:119"/>which is therefore called the <hi>Day of the Lord's power Pſ.</hi> 110.3.<note place="margin">

                  <p>In a word, true and great, and marvellous, and invincible is the light of this day, concerning which, much might be ſpoken from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the Prophets, who prophecyed of this day, and much might be added from the triumphant exultations of the Apoſtles, whoſe eyes were firſt opened to ſee the light of this day: but there is no need to undertake any further the clearing of the truth of this point, for the day it ſelf doth declare it, the Sun which is the light and life of this day, being not onely riſen, but aſcended, and not onely riſen and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, but fixed in his Meridian, never more to deſcend, till time be no more.<note place="margin">

And for ever and ever bleſſed be that good Providence of Heaven that hath brought us to ſee the Light of this Day, making it unto us a good Day, A Day of good tidings, A day of Reconciliation with the God of Heaven, A Day of joy and gladneſs; Let us therefore I ſay again and again rejoyce and be glad in it: Let the Children of the World glory, ſome in their carnal wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42108:120"/>ſome in their ſtrength, ſome in their riches, But let us glory in this that we underl and and know the Lord. Now in this ſerene and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day of his gracious viſitation, did <hi>Abraham</hi> with great pleaſure and rapture of ſpirit rejoyce to ſee this day afar off, and ſhall not we now rejoyce when it is at hand, yea, when it comes upon us, and the Light of it ſhineth round about us? Surely we are not <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, unleſs we do the works of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and if herein we do not rejoyce, we are not of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and conſequently ſhall not be bleſſed with him.</p>

                  <p>True, you'll ſay, But alas we remember God and are troubled, for his Anger we ſee is enkindled, it ſmoketh againſt the ſheep of his Paſture; By terrible things in Righteouſneſs doth God anſwer his People now in this day when they call upon him, chiding and chaſtning them very ſore, ſhould we then make mirth?</p>

But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, though this be a day of rebuke, Is it not a time alſo of Love? Nay, when with rebukes the Lord doth correct his people, is there not both love and faithfulneſs to be found in the bottom of thoſe rebukes, which makes them very ſweet unto the ſoul of a Believer? Beſides can we not diſtinguiſh between the ſorrowful diſpenſations of Providence whenſoever they come upon us, and the glorious diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of grace? If the former be matter of ſorrow, the latter are of joy; Rejoyce therefore in the Lord alwayes, and again I ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>
                  <p>Oh but it is a day of blaſphemy, And who that hath a tender regard to God's glory, and the Churches Welfare can chuſe but ſigh and mourn to ſee and hear the Abominations that are ſo frequent this day?

                  <p>I Anſwer, For theſe things indeed let us be humbled and walk mournfully before the Lord, let horrour feiſe upon us as it was with the Holy Prophet,<note place="margin">

But we muſt know that this kinde of ſorrow and humiliation is to be manifeſted in denying our ſelves that natural and lawful joy and liberty we may take ſometimes in the free uſe of the Creatures, not at all in quenching our ſpiritual joy, We rejoyce not in iniquity, but we rejoyce in the truth, this joy no man nor no Devil ſhould take from us, becauſe God hath called us to it, and calleth upon us for it. All this therefore hindereth not, but that we may and ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Light of this day, though there be much affliction upon the Church, rebuke from God, iniquity and blaſphemy among men to be ſeen in it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Duty.</hi>
                     </note> ſuffer the Light of this day to ſhine in upon your ſoules, that the beams thereof may have their free and clear penetration into every corner of your inner man. If ye be Children of light; and Children of the day ſprung from the womb of the morning, you will be ſtill craving after light, ambitious of a Conformity to the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your extraction: yea, light is your proper element, and the more you are ſwallowed up in it, the more comfortable ſhall your life be unto you. Miſ-mean me not; I exhort you not now to ſtand ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing after a Light that is too high for your reach, or to break through God's pavilion to that light that is inacceſſible. There is a knowledge too wonderful for poor man, which while he is cloathed with mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yea, and in ſome reſpect when his mortality hath put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, He ſhall never be able to attain unto. Neither do I call upon you to look after thoſe new lights, which the varity and darkneſs of theſe times do ſo much cry up and extol; for ſure I am, that which is new in point of Salvation cannot be true, A poſition, though much diſliked by ſome giddy heads, may well be maintained againſt Men and Angels: Yea, whatſoever may be obtruded upon you as a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Light that ſhall appear in this Noontide of the Goſpel to be of ſo narrow an extent, that it hath not or cannot overſpread the whole Hemiſphere of the Church, is moſt certainly counterfeit, a prodigious comet, portending ſome ſtrong deluſions, rather then a true fixed light, derived from the fountain of light, For ſaith Chriſt himſelf,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.24</note> 
                     <hi>As the lightning that lightneth from one part under Heaven
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42108:121"/>ſhineth to the other part under heaven, ſo alſo is the Son of man in his day,</hi> Not onely in the great day of his glorious appearance, but even in this his day: He is not concluded within the narrow confines of <hi>Africa,</hi> as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of old would have him, Nor in the conclave at <hi>Rome</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at this day fooliſhly imagine, Nor in the Deſart, that is, in the ſeparation amongſt thoſe that now-a-days forſake the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, Nor in their ſecret Chambers, that is, in the Conventicles of Schiſmaticks; But his going forth is from the end of Heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it, his Church hath infallibly, univerſally been inlightned by him, with that knowledge that is neceſſary to Salvation, unto which, whoſoever ſhall add, is a Deceiver, and to be anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by all the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Putting away therefore theſe vanities, Let your ſoules give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to that Light, which this Day preſenteth unto you. And ſo much the rather, becauſe the Prince of darkneſs hath raiſed up many foggie, noiſome, palpable miſts to obſcure this light, with which miſts the eyes of a multitude of people pretending to Holineſs are miſerably blinded.</p>
                  <p>And now if it be demanded, what this light is? I Anſwer</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is the light of Life: not a dead light,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.12.</note> as the light of ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday was, which conſiſted in carnal Ordinances, and dead Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but a living light, that is, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who though he was dead to extinguiſh the former Light, yet being quickned by the Spirit, he liveth to eſtabliſh this new Light, that ſhall therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly continue to the end of the World. For <hi>behold,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>I am alive for evermore,</hi> affixing his Seale with an <hi>Amen,</hi> to note the unalterableneſs of his preſent eſtate. Hee, I ſay again, is this light of life, not like unto other lights that have no Life in them; whoſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the Sun in the firmament 'tis true hath light, but it is a Light wanting life; when death cometh, it cannot give him life, becauſe it hath it not to give; <hi>There is</hi> indeed <hi>hope of a tree,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.7.10.</note> 
                     <hi>when it is cut down that it may live again,</hi> ſaith Job, <hi>and that the tender Branch thereof will not ceaſe, but when Man giveth up the Ghoſt, where is Hee?</hi> Not the ſent of water, nor the light nor heat of the Sun, can be able to revive him; But ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Hee that followeth mee hath the light of Life,</hi> that is, my ſelf.

                     <hi>In him was Life and that Life was the Light of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then here you ſee what is the light of this day that you are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to receive, It is Chriſt Jeſus; let him come therefore into your ſouls, He will bring both light and life with him, light into your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, whereby you ſhall get more intimate Acquaintance in the great Myſtery of Godlineſs, and life into your Affections raiſing them above the World, and from groveling in fleſh and bloud, to a ſpiritual elevation; light to direct you in the way, and life to quicken you in it; light to comfort you in your troubles, and life to deliver you out of them; the light of the life of grace here, and the light of the life of glory hereafter: Awake therefore thou that ſleepeſt, riſe up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Light.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The light of this day is the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.</note> ſhewing to the world ſuch glorious Myſteries which before this day could not be ſo clearly known, ſuch as the Incarnation of God, the expiation of ſin by his death, the freeneſs of Salvation through faith in a Mediatour, remedy againſt the Curſe and mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the rigour of the Law, reconciliation with God, ſpiritual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations of the New Covenant, all which and many more had never been manifeſted to the Children of Men, had not the day ſprung from on high, even from the <hi>Zenith</hi> of the Heaven of Heavens, viſited the Church with this glorious light, and therefore is it well worthy to be entertained by us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is called the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God, then which nothing can to the Saints be more deſireable, and unto which, when the Soul hath in the utmoſt extent of her Capacity fully attained ſhe is fully ſatisfied, ſetting up her reſt with a <hi>Ne plus ultra,</hi> as the Prophet confeſſed ſaying, I ſhall be ſatisfied when thy Glory ſhall appear. When as therefore this glory now appeareth in ſome glimpſes to the Soule, whiles ſhe is ſhut up in this Corps of Clay, ſuch Apparitions being the <hi>Praeludium</hi> of that perfect happineſs that is to come, muſt needs be very welcome. Now the Light of this Day ſheweth unto the Soule of a Believer, ſo far as it is capable, the Glory of God, <hi>viz.</hi> The Glory of his Wiſdome, the Glory of his Power, the Glory of his Grace and Goodneſs, with other his glorious Attributes, in the Protection of his people, in the fulfilling of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, in the propagating of his Goſpel; yea, it filleth the Soule with
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42108:122"/>Joy and Gladneſs, raiſing it up to a Life Heavenly and Angelical, And therefore well worthy of Acceptation.</p>
                  <p>Conſider I beſeech you, ſhall the Glory of the Lord ſhine round about us, and ſhall not we open our Hearts to let it in? Have we a Price put into our Hands to get Wiſdome, and ſhall we have no heart unto it? God forbid! Yea, let us not content our ſelves with that which we have already attain'd,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31.</note> but labour to ſee more and more of this Glory, <hi>covet earneſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, As we muſt rejoyce in the Light of this Day,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Duty</hi>
                     </note> and receive it into our Hearts, ſo are we to walke in it, and by it, ordering our whole Converſation according unto it, otherwiſe we are very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it.</p>
                  <p>And here give me leave a while to lead you into that Walke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a holy couple whoſe Praiſe is in the Goſpel, were wont to walke, <hi>They Walked,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt,<note place="margin">

So alſo is this Day ſet apart and appointed by God for his people to walk in, that is, to worke, for ſo is a holy walking before God inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted in Scripture, e. g. <hi>I muſt</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Walke to day, and to morrow, and the day following,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.33. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10.</note> ſpeaking of his workes which he wrought at that time: And <hi>good workes</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10.) <hi>God hath ordained that we ſhould walke in them.</hi> This Light therefore muſt not be conſumed in vain, not whelm'd under the Buſhel of filthy lucre, nor hid under the Bed of ſlothfull Negligence, but we muſt make uſe of it to ſhew us our way, and to guide us in our worke. Let us then
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42108:123"/>ariſe and walke, up and be doing: not ſpend the day in hearing and talking onely as the manner of ſome is; For as the light of the Sun is no help to the Eares and Tongues of men, but to their hands and feet to walke and worke in: ſo is the Light of this Day ſet up for other ends and purpoſes then for people to ſit and chat by (pardon the Word) for ſuch in truth is all the Twanging of Religion upon the Tongues end, ſo much affected in theſe dayes, without doing. It is the working Believer that is the onely Believer, and whoſoever ſhall ſay the contrary, <hi>he is a Deceiver</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, For he that doth Righteouſneſs is Righteous.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7.</note> Let no man therefore make a flouriſh of his Faith (though he could remove Mountains therewith.) Unleſs he walke in Love, nor ſay he is a Profeſſour, unleſs he be alſo a Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Piety: A vain thing it is for a man to boaſt how far he will walke to heare a Sermon, unleſs he will ſhew out of a good Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, how far he will walke to do a Sermon. Oh it is doing, it is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is the Ornament of Religion, the Crown of a Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, It is the end and ſum of all, as we may learn from a good Arithmetician, when he had caſt up all his Accounts, <hi>Let us heare,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>The concluſion of the whole matter, fear God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, for this is the whole Duty of man,</hi> upon which a Reverend Divine of our times gloſſeth in this manner, it is as if he had ſaid, I will in two words give you an Abridgement of all that can be ſpoken. A tedious thing it is to write many Books, and as tedious to read them, but if a man ſhould write a hundred, nay read over a thouſand; This is the upſhot and end of all, <hi>viz.</hi> To fear God, for his inward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to keep his Commandments, for his outward Service: Loe, this is the end of man, the perfection of the creature, all that is written tends to this, all that's commanded, all that's promiſed, all that's threatned, all that's done for or againſt man in Scripture may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd into this, to ſtir us up to a holy and upright walking with God, and to a working out our own Salvation, according to that Light which this Day bringeth unto us.</p>
                  <p>And now the better to quicken us hereunto, let us take theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions along with us.</p>
                  <p>Conſider it is the deſigne,<note place="margin">Firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tive.</note> the great deſigne of the God of Heaven which he hath undertaken this Day againſt all the Machinations of Hell, to ſave his people from their ſins, and to reſcue them from the common Deſtruction, which the old Serpent called the Devil and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanas
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42108:123"/>had with deep Subtlety, and in the blackeſt and darkeſt Caverne of his inveterate malice contrived againſt the whole race of mankind. To bring which glorious deſign to paſs, was the Light of this Day with infinite Wiſdome formed, And being ſo formed, God ſaw that it was very good, good to diſcover the Counter-workings of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and Good to guide his people in all their wayes, till they have quite eſcaped the danger, and entred into his reſt with joy. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over as he hath begun his deſign, ſo his deſire is very earneſt that it might go on and proſper without any let or hinderance from thoſe, for whoſe ſakes he undertook it; therefore do we finde him very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in Scripture calling to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 81.13. <hi>Deut</hi> 5.29. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42.</note> 
                     <hi>Oh that my people had hearkned unto me, and that</hi> Iſrael <hi>had walked in my wayes.

Thus all the day long, he reacheth out his hand, and ſtretcheth out his voice unto us, leaſt by our back-ſlidings and treacherous tampering with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations in our way, we give advantage to the Enemy to interrupt the Lord in this day of his power, in the perfecting his work, his great work.</p>
                  <p>And now I beſeech you brethren. If the Lord hath of his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mercy been careful with all this care for a Company of poor Creatures that were ready to periſh, ſetting up ſuch a light, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly helpful unto them in their way, as that without it, they could never be able to keep themſelves upright, but muſt undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtumble and fall into utter ruine, ſhould they not do well then to take heed unto it, that they walk in it? And ſhould they not do very ill to turn their Backs upon it, thereby ſo much as in them lieth, to fruſtrate the deſign of the Almighty for their good? Conſider, ſhall the Lord the great and glorious God declare the vehement deſires of his Soul unto us, and ſhall not we regard them? That be far from us! For us, It is but ask and have with God, He bids us open our mouth wide and promiſeth that he will fill it; When he ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſh and deſire a thing of us, it is but reaſon that we ſhould rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant it. The wiſhes and deſires of Kings work mightily upon loving and loyal Subjects. No difficulty ſhall hinder the fulfilling of them, as when <hi>David</hi> did but ſignifie a deſire to drink of the water of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> meaning onely if he could have had it with a wiſh, not
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42108:124"/>requiring, or ſo much as intending that any ſhould fetch it with the hazard of their lives, yet, immediately three of his mighty men brake through the Hoſte of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and drew of the water, and brought it unto him; <hi>Scipio Africanus;</hi> being in <hi>Sicile,</hi> preparing for his expedition into <hi>Africk,</hi> when one asked him, what made him ſo confident, being a young man, to equipp a Navy for the invaſion of ſo great a Countrey, he preſently ſhewed 300 of his Souldiers that were before him, and pointed likewiſe to a high Tower, whoſe top was prominent over the Sea, ſaying unto him, <hi>There is not one of theſe Couragious and ſtout fellows that you ſee, but without delay would get up to the top of this Turret, and throw himſelf head-long into the Sea, if I commanded him.</hi> And ſhall mortal man prevaile more to have his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires fulfilled, then the Almighty God, who ruleth and governeth all things, can have with thoſe people that profeſs ſubjection unto him? Eſpecially when his deſire is towards them for their own good? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if there were that loyalty in our hearts towards God as there ought to be, we could not but give our conſent unto whatſoever he ſhall deſire.<note place="margin">

And it is our own Salvation that we are called upon to work out, ſo that a threefold Cord is here twiſted together to draw us to a diligent walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the light of this day according to God's Commands, <hi>viz</hi> God's deſign of our Salvation which we ſhould not fruſtrate, his deſire which we ſhould ſatisfie, and our own intereſt and benefit which we ſhould be ſo wiſe as to promote to the uttermoſt of our power, therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and walk, up and be doing,</p>

                  <p>You have I ſay a great journey to go, <hi>viz.</hi> through all the wayes of God's Commandments before you can get to Heaven.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.96</note> And theſe Commandments are exceeding broad, yet muſt you traverſe them in their whole breadth, having reſpect unto every particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſo far as you are concerned therein. In this journey there muſt be no picking and chuſing of our way according to our own fancies, nor turning aſide from any one Commandment; for, he that turneth away from the holy Commandment,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</note> it had been better for him that he had never known, nor entred into the way of Righteouſneſs at all. And now alas how is it poſſible for a poor weak Creature, blinde and lame (ſuch are we all, the beſt of us all, of our ſelves) to walk ſteddily in this way, and to continue in it to the end, unleſs he hath the light of this day to go before him, which alone is ordained of God to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct therein? eſpecially conſidering withall the variety and multitude of buſineſſes that are to be done in the way:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Biſhop</hi> Reinolds.</note> Let us take notice of them as they are prepared to our hands by a skilful Workman, one of a thouſand. Chriſt, ſaith he, hath ſervice much more then enough to take up all the Might, ſtrength, ſtudies, abilities, times, callings of all his ſervants, buſineſſes towards God and himſelf, worſhip, fear, Communion, Love, Prayer, Obedience, Service, Subjection; Buſineſſes towards and for our ſelves, watchfulneſs, repentance, Faith, Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Sobriety, Growth in grace; Buſineſses towards other men as inſtruments and fellow-members, exhortation, reproof, direction,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42108:125"/>inſtruction, mourning, rejoycing, reſtoring, relieving, helping, praying, ſerving in all wayes of love: ſo much evil to be avoided, ſo many ſlips and errours to be lamented, ſo many earthly members to be crucified, ſo much knowledge and myſteries to be learned, ſo many vain prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to be unlearned, ſo much good to be done to my ſelf, ſo much ſervice to be done to my brother, ſo much glory to be brought to my maſter, every Chriſtian hath his hands full of work: and can all this be done; without light? Or will you ſtand all the day idle, as if you had not been hired at all into the Lord's Vine-yard, but ſtill continue in the market-place of the World amongſt thoſe that are without? But be it known unto you, you have been hired, and the penny of eternal life hath been offered unto you again and again; therefore woe unto you if you ſtand out any longer. As yet there is day light for you to come in, but you know not how ſoon it will expire.</p>
                  <p>Which indeed ought alſo to be thought upon by us as another ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Conſideration to quicken us in our way.<note place="margin">4 <hi>Motive.</hi>
                     </note> This day I ſay will have an end, and we know not how ſoon the myſtery of God will be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and the Oath fulfilled, that time ſhall be no more.

                        <hi>Job</hi> 7.1.</note> that is, very ſhort and uncertain: ſo that how ſhort this day of the Goſpel may be to us we cannot tell; and many times it is made ſhorter then the dayes of our lives, being through God's juſt indignation taken from us, leaving us in the darkneſs of our own fooliſh hearts, and under the power of the Prince of darkneſs, becauſe we chuſe darkneſs rather then light. Very needful then it is to hearken to the advice which the Lord giveth <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.35. <hi>Walk</hi> ſaith he <hi>in the light while you have the light, leaſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs come upon you,</hi> And alſo to follow his example, <hi>I muſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>work the work of him that ſent me,</hi>

                     <hi>while it is day, the night cometh wherein no man can work.</hi> We ſee daily that the Sun in the firmament hath his riſing and ſetting, he cometh forth of his Chamber in the morning like a Bridegroom, and retires again at even: Thus in like manner is it with the light of this day: it came forth <hi>De umbraculo ſuo,</hi> out of its place, where it lay ſhadowed before in the Tabernacle of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or if you will <hi>De thalamo</hi> (for the word will bear both) out of the Preſence-Chamber of the God of Heaven, where it was trimmed after the form of a Bridegroom in a more gorgeous manner then formerly it had been: and being come forth, hitherto like a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42108:125"/>ſtrong man he hath run his race, bearing down all oppoſition, driving before it the darkneſs of <hi>Judaiſme, Helleniſme, Paganiſme, Papiſme,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> and what ever it be that is contrary to ſound doctrine: But being in a race, it will have an end, and we may probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that it is well neere finiſhed: For as the coole of the day doth foretell the approaching of the night, ſo that coldneſs of love, which was foretold to be in the laſt times, and is now too palpably to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned in the World, doth plainly demonſtrate the ſetting of our Sun to be very neere. Yea, and Satan alſo hath great wrath, becauſe hee hath but a ſhort time to work for his Kingdom, knowing well that the end of this day will be concluding of his whole deſign againſt the Kingdom of Chriſt. Do not theſe things I ſay ſignifie to us, that the day goeth away and that the ſhadows of the evening are ſtretched out. That our Sun is declining, and his race even almoſt at an end.</p>
                  <p>Work therefore now for your lives, if ever you will do it, the night cometh wherein no man can work. Could we ſpeak to the light of this day, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did unto the Sun, to ſtand ſtill and make it ſlay our leiſure, we might then take our own time? But as all our times, ſo eſpecially this is in the hand of God; and as no worldly or infernal power can precipitate this day, or cut ſhort the hours thereof, ſo can none protract it beyond that meaſure, which the grave and wiſe antient of dayes hath appointed unto it. The day is his, and the night is his, ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> the day, I ſay, of the goſpel, and the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it (as well particular to ſome Perſons and Nations, as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal at the end of the World) are in his power under his irreverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble decree, to be ordered according to the good pleaſure of his Will; and therefore out of our reach to be interrupted in their courſe by any thing that we can do. Ariſe then and walk, Up and be doing, leaſt dreadful darkneſs ſeize upon you before you be aware. It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Hiſtorians of <hi>Titus Veſpaſianus</hi> (entituled by them <hi>deliciae hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani generis,</hi> becauſe he delighted to do good unto all) that when he had ſpent a day without doing ſomewhat whereby the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth or ſome private perſons might be benefited by him, he was wont to ſay <hi>Diem perdidi,</hi> the day is loſt; O let us conſider the day is well nigh ſpent, and the night is at hand, If now we ſtand idle, and will do nothing, or if we be ſlothful in the multitude of buſineſſes,<note place="margin">

                  <p>To Conclude, Let us according to the Advice of the Apoſtle <hi>walk honeſtly,</hi>

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13.</note> that is, Decently as in the Day, in all the Commandments of the Lord, doing that which is good in his ſight (for this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that honeſt decency which adorns a believer, and ſets a beautiful luſtre upon his holy profeſſion) In which <hi>Adviſo</hi> the Apoſtle ſeems to allude to the civil Cuſtomes and Manners of people that are modeſt in the World, who are wont both in their apparel and deportment to demean themſelves decently in the day time, and will while they are in the light be aſhamed that any thing diſhoneſt and unſeemely ſhould be found upon them, or acted by them: whereupon he would have us alſo that believe to learn and remember to bear ſuch a reſpect unto this day of the Goſpel, and the light ſhining about us, as to have our Converſation honeſt, and to do nothing uncomely in it, <hi>No Rioting or drunkenneſs, no Chambering or Wantonneſs,</hi> nor other the like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoneſt works of Darkneſs ſhould be ſeen amongſt us, which in this day will cover us with ſhame to the loathing of our perſons in the Eyes of God, and his Holy angels: Away with them therefore, and let us walk honeſtly.</p>
                  <p>And now for a cloſe of this Exhortation, I ſhall take liberty to ſpeak a word unto you in ſeaſon, If you be Children of the day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the deeds of darkneſs in this time wherein you pretend to remember the Nativity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It is not my work to argue againſt the ſolemnity which Yeſterday, to Day, and ſome Dayes following, is ſtill held up and continued among us; neither will I undertake (as the manner is) to judge any man here preſent in the freedom of his Conſcience for his obſerving this Anniverſary Feſtival, yea though his obſervation of it be accompanied with a more then ordinary uſe of the good Creatures of God, provided that he doth, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, obſerve it to the Lord. But I beſeech you, Is this to celebrate the Nativity of the Lord, to run into exceſs of Riot,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42108:126"/>and to let looſe the reins into all manner of diſorder and Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Is this to Commemorate the Birth of Chriſt, to ſpend the time in gourmardizing and ſwiniſh Drunkeneſs? <hi>Siccine exprimitur publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum gandium per publicum dedecus? Haeccine ſolennes dies decent, quae alios non decent?</hi> Will you ſo teſtiſie your publick rejoycing, as to make your ſelves a publick ſhame? Do ſuch things become theſe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival dayes which are ſcandalous and unbecoming thoſe that profeſs the name of Chriſt upon other days? It was the complaint of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> in his time, and we have too much reaſon to make uſe of it now. O my Brethren, beware I fay again of the unfruitful works of darkneſs at this time, if you be the Children of the Day. And a needful Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat it is, for I think it hath been too truely ſaid, God hath been more diſhonoured in many places of this land by Rioting and Drunkenneſs, and other Abominations in the twelve dayes, then in all the twelve months following. Let us therefore I ſay again walk honeſtly as in the Day, and as becomes Children of the day in all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>I have I confeſs been ſomewhat large in handling this ſubject. But the day will not fail us, though we take a turn or two more then ordinary in walking this round, I mean in meditating upon this holy walk, and in exhorting one another while it is called to day, to beſtir ourſelves in it.</p>
                  <p>Let us now paſs on to the other ſide of this walk, that is, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord, for they indeed are the excellency and glory of this day; and methinks it ſhould be our endeavour, yea, it ſhould be our Ambition to exerciſe our ſelves in this walk alſo more frequently then we do. What greater happineſs can there be in this world, then to walk with God, and to hold a ſweet correſpondency with him? To pour out our complaints before him, to make known our requeſts unto him, and to receive inſtruction and benedictions from him? what a priviledge is it peculiar to this day, to finde the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Regal and Pontifical attire, walking in the midſt of the ſeven golden Candleſticks, that is, in the aſſemblies of his people, breathing upon them with his ſpirit, and inſinuating himſelf kindly into their hearts by his word and Sacraments? Are not the goings of the Lord, the Lord I ſay our God and our King in his Sanctuary, worthy to be traced by us, eſpecially, when the ſavour of his Oyntments doth ſo ſpread it ſelf that it is ſenſibly to be diſcerned? What, do not the words of God do good to thoſe that walk uprightly? Shall God all
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42108:127"/>the day long from the riſing of the Sun to the going down of the ſame, ſtretch out his hands unto us, filled with the choiceſt of his bleſſings that ever he did hold out to the Children of men, And ſhall not we put forth our hands to receive them? Is it nothing to have Satan fall down like Lightning before us in the powerful diſpenſations of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Ordinances? O how happy were we, if we knew our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs?</p>
                  <p>But ſince I am fallen upon a ſerious expoſtulation in this caſe, ſuffer me I beſeech you good brethren that belong unto this Congregation, to bring it home to your Conſciences by a particular application; and without offenſe bee that ſpeech, which is intended not to offend, but onely to affect with a clear Truth.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday, it is like, if there had been a Sermon in this place, here would have been a full Congregation; To day alſo it appeareth our Aſſembly is greater then it was wont to be upon theſe dayes, yet yeſterday, and to day, and all our dayes, what do we that are your Miniſters but work the work of him that ſent us, preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt (he is Lord of all) Whence is it then that our Meſſage is deſpiſed? That the holy and divine Ordinance of preaching is ſo much ſleighted by your abſenting your ſelves upon ſuch dayes of the week wherein Miniſters come freely to impart unto you ſome ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al gift, ſuch as they have received from the Lord? If indeed we did preach any other Goſpel, then that which the Church of God hath received from the beginning, or any other Jeſus then him who is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, ye might have juſt cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe our miniſtery, and to hold us accurſed. But when we bring unto you no other doctrine of ſalvation then that which hath been profeſſed and maintained by the Church of God in all Ages, ſealed and confirmed by the bloud of Martyres, yea by the bloud of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, accompanied alſo with the mighty operations of the ſpirit of God to the converſion and ſalvation of multitudes that hear it, how can you without contracting unto your ſelves an extraordinary guilt in the ſight of God, refuſe as you do to reſort to this place at ſuch times, when this word is faithfully preached, having no <hi>lawful lett</hi> to hinder you, and to keep you from it? Do you not hereby openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim unto the world that you have no care of your ſouls, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of them, whether they ſink or ſwim, whether they ſaved or damned?<note place="margin">

Since then the Lord hath commanded us this ſervice, we had not beſt ſtand arguing ſtill about the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it, and in the mean time leave it quite undone: But let Miniſters and People look to it betimes, leaſt the anger of the Lord ſmoke yet more and more againſt them for their diſobedience.

And oh that I were now a <hi>Boaner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> that I might with the Thunder and Lightning of this day rouze and ſtartle ſuch Sleepers out of their ſloth and ſecurity, wherein they are willing to lie down, like thoſe the Prophet ſpeakes of Eſ. 56.10.

Look up, O ye poor Creatures, behold and ſee, <hi>the Night is paſt, and the Day is come,</hi> the Morning is not onely ſpread upon the Mountains, and the Day Star in his Courſe driving before it the ſhadowes of the Night, but the Sun hath ſhined out in his full ſtrength. What? Are you not aſhamed thus to turne Day into Night, and to lie ſnorting in your ſinfull Security, whiles ſo glorious a Light ſhineth round about you? If you will ſtill ſhut your Eyes; let your Eares yet be open to that Goſpel-Thunder clap (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19.) and let them tingle to heare it,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>But let us a little take theſe ſleepers apart one from another, and proclaime before them the Day of the Lord.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42108:128"/>but take Pleaſure to walke on in Darkneſs, and will not ſee the Light, very apt to learn how to carry on a Deſign to your Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in things of this World, but ſtarke fooles in the myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; Conſider, Is this a time to be Ignorant, when the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God hath ſhined out, not in the vailed face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as it did Yeſterday, but in the glorious face of Jeſus Chriſt? Is this day of the great things of God ſo illuſtriouſly viſible, to be deſpiſed? Or is there ſuch Comelineſs and Beauty in the Black hue and prodigious feature of darkneſs, that men ſhould ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it? The times of former ignorance God was pleaſed to wink at, but now he commands all men every where to repent. Awake, Awake therefore you that have hitherto deſpiſed knowledge, Awake I ſay, open your eyes now, if ever you will ſee; for if this Goſpel which this day hath ſo demonſtratively made known to the World be as a Hidden thing unto you, it is an evident token of your everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perdition.</p>
                  <p>But if this Day doth produce ſuch Terrour, and prove ſo Diſmal for thoſe that are ignorant, oh what a black Day is it like to be unto thoſe that are Profane? Let Swearers, and Liars, and Drunkards, and Oppreſſours, and unclean Adulterers, and cruel Mockers and Deſpiſers of Goſpel-Ordinances, with all the reſt of that Rabble that lie down in the Lethargy of Sin, tremble and be horribly afraid at the Apparitions of this Day: Since you will not open your Eyes to ſee the Light of it, you muſt and ſhall abide the evil that attends upon it. The evil I ſay how ſtrange ſoever it ſounds in the eares of men unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with God and his Word, who think of this Day, as if there were nothing but calmnes and ſerenity in it; And truely to a Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that walks in the light of it, It is a day, as hath been ſaid, of rich and abundant Grace, A joyful day:<note place="margin">

But what talke you of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſecurity? Did you never hear that <hi>God rains down ſnares here upon his enemies, as well as fire and brimstone, ſtorme and tempeſt? And that the proſperity of fooles ſhall deſtroy them?</hi> What advantage then have you by theſe outward things, wherein you ſo much pride your ſelves, and applaud your own happineſs, When they ſhall be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in bringing you to utter ruine. In the mean time, oh how doth the Soul lie ſcorching under the burning heat of this day? Which though it be by ſome but little felt, yet it is the foreſt judgment of all other; for as the Lightning never pierceth more fiercely then when it melteth the ſword, and hurteth not the ſcabberd, ſo is the wrath of God never more incenſed then when he puniſheth the ſoul and ſpares the body. Look then into thy ſoul, O poor Sinner, and ſee what this
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42108:129"/>day doth there bring forth, either an obduration upon thy heart, or an inflammation upon thy Conſcience. O how is the heart ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hardened in ſin? Made more and more obſtinate and perverſe againſt the Lord? Yea, and that which aggravates the miſery, it is by that very means whereby the Saints are renewed, and made happy in their Conformity to God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs; for as the heat of the Sun ſofteneth wax and hardeneth clay both at the ſame time, ſo hath the light of this day its ſeveral operations upon the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Ungodly according to their ſeveral Capacities, and diſpoſitions, The one it brings into an humble frame fit for ſuch impreſſions as the ſpirit of God will fix upon them, The other are thereby made more and more refractory and inflexible in their ſin, till they be ripe for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And is not this a great terrour unto men, that, that which might have been for their wealth, to enrich them with grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhould become unto them an occaſion of falling into extream mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie? Sometimes again the Conſcience of an impenitent ſinner is ſet all on fire by the light of this day, and put into ſuch a flame that nothing can quench it; yea, the more illuminations it hath of the glimpſes of that glorious grace which is now revealed, the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent flaſhes of God's glittering ſword do withall break in upon it to the amazing of the ſoul with terrours that are inextricable and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible. A black cloud of Witneſſes might be produced that have found this true by too lamentable experience. Not as if this light did naturally bring forth ſuch ſad effects, but whereſoever it ſhineth, being mighty to prevail, if it be reſiſted (wo unto them that make the oppoſition) it comes I ſay like Lightning with greater Violence, and where it meets with ſuch combuſtible ſtuff as a reprobate Spirit, it proves through the juſt judgement of God a devouring fire.</p>
                  <p>True it is that even the moſt holy and faithful ſervants of God may ſometimes for want of a due obſervation of this day, have terrible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of it, The light of it may ſeem to go altogether retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade unto them, and the illuminations thereof may alſo turn into dreadful inflammation upon their Conſciences: But yet becauſe they are <hi>the Children of the Day,</hi> The healing which is under the wings of that Sun that giveth light unto it, ſhall ſurely have a comfortable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon them, And the anointing which they have from the Holy one, ſhall be as an eye-ſalve, whereby they may ſee the light more clearly, and a preſervative likewiſe, ſo to keep them, as that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

                  <p>Where are now all your glorious boaſtings of this day of the Lord?

Yet we will hope howſoever that all ſhall be well in the end: Alas, Alas miſerable people your expectation will be fruſtrated, and all your hopes vaniſh away like the ſpiders Web.

                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.19.</note> which are ſweeter then Honey to thoſe that live in Gods fear, are unto you, ſo long as you abide in your profaneſs no better then poiſon. You have been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with water, whereby you are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are without God in the World, But if your Souls lie ſtill wallowing in the pollutions of ſin, it ſhall be more tolerable for Infidels and Pagans at the day of judgement then for you. When you come to the Lord's Table, to which you may pretend a right, becauſe you outwardly profeſs the faith of Chriſt Crucified, neither are you to be repelled from it, untill you be juridically caſt out, But when you come, O what a woful hazard do you run? I need not tell it you in any other words then thoſe the Apoſtle uſeth, You eate and drink your own Damnation. The Word alſo when you hear it proves not onely a dead but a deadly Letter ſent unto you from Heaven to pronounce your Condemnation; yea, all the Exhortations, Admonitions, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, Reprehenſions that you meet with from Miniſters, from friends, from enemies, from your own Conſciences, bring forth no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruit then to ſink you deeper into Hell. Your continued rejecting of that rich and abundant grace that is freely and frequently tendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, ſets you every day at a further diſtance from God, gives the devil more hold-faſt of you, adds more fewel unto your <hi>Tophet,</hi> making your torment hereafter the more inſupportable.

                  <p>If any ſhould yet enquire how it comes to paſs that this inevitable miſery falls upon theſe wretched kind of people that we have been ſpeaking of, I muſt anſwer, There are two things which the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture doth plainly preſent unto us as the grounds and cauſes thereof.

Now it is, that ſin is become exceeding ſinful, that is, hath gotten more ſtrength to do miſchief then formerly it was wont to do, putting more malignity and perverſneſs into the hearts of men then ever, and affronting the Almighty with the greateſt impudence, deſpiſing thoſe means which Divine Wiſdom hath found out for the ſuppreſſing of it, Now it appears in its proper colours, inſomuch that, as our Saviour ſaid, It is inexcuſeable,<note place="margin">

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42108:133"/>Jeſus Chriſt in the execution of his Mediatorial Office: For that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath been the work of this day, And which hath made this day more glorious then yeſterday. Yeſterday 'tis true he was, as it is ſaid before, the onely Mediatour between God and man, being ordained of the Father to that high honour, but it was by virtue of that which he hath to day actually accompliſhed both in his life, and in his death. Whatſoever therefore hath been ſpoken concerning him muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with a reference unto the work of this day, whereby all the former mediation in the High Court of Heaven for the Fathers of old, is made good and effectual in the Law of God, and ratified for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p>And this ſpeaks him ſtill to be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the ſame, or the onely he, who was willing in this day of his power to perfect for ever them that in all the Ages of the Church, have been, are, or ſhall be ſanctified, that is, conſecrated and ſeparated out of the world, and dedicated to be veſſels of honour unto God.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall not enter into a large ſurvey of that which Chriſt hath done and ſuffered, nor make any ſtrict ſearch into his office, whereby it may in all points be made manifeſt that he hath now in this time of the Goſpel fully perfected the work of redemption, and ſo proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the ſame to day which he was yeſterday: We have ſpoken ſomewhat of theſe things before, and therefore ſhall for bear to ſpeak much of them now; and there have been Writers of late who have magnified the Office of Chriſts Mediatourſhip, therein doing emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervice both unto him and his Church: Yet it is but meet that we ſhould, for our methods ſake, take this ſweet ſubject alſo along with us, though it be folded up but in ſome general termes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened particularly would enlarge our diſcourſe too much, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in already I may be judged by ſome to have gone beyond my bounds.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt of the <hi>Revelation</hi> we read how the Lord Jeſus Chriſt appears unto his beloved Diſciple St. <hi>John</hi> clothed in his regal and pontifical attire,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13.</note> intimating that he is now ready fitted for that whole Oeconomy, to which he was deſigned from the beginning, and imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is now ſolemnly inaugurated into and poſſeſſed with that honour which did alwayes belong unto his Office. Never did he in all his apparitions of old ſhew himſelf in ſuch a manner, as now he doth: This garment was then laid up, as I may ſay, in the Cabinet of Gods
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42108:134"/>Purpoſe and Decree, wherein the ſmell of it was very acceptable to the Father, inclining him to give out his bleſſing to his children, who did then by faith, according to their capacity, lay hold upon it. But now ſince that this our great Lord Advocate and Mediatour, the firſt begotten among many brethren, hath been actually called of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his office, and aſſumed the right of his Primogeniture, he appears veſted with it, exerciſing his authority, fulfilling the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and confirming all that he hath done in the preſervation of his people, and their reception to himſelf ſince the World began: With which confirmation Divine Juſtice reſts her ſelf fully ſatisfied, and the Pleas of the Law, and the clamours of Satan are all huſht and ſilenced. Having then thus put on this garment for the execution of his office, what doth it argue, but that he is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, the ſame which he was from the beginning? A Prophet to day, as he was yeſterday, teaching his people the way of God truly, and fore-telling them what ſhall happen to them in the way, A Prieſt to day as he was yeſterday, wherein he hath offered up a ſacrifice for ſin, and maketh interceſſion for us, A King to day as he was yeſterday, protecting, preſerving, and providing for his Church, ruling in the midſt of his people, ruling alſo in the midſt of his enemies. Preciſely and punctually the ſame as yeſterday without any variableneſs or ſhadow of turning. Yea ſo far is he now from being defective in any thing that concerns his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that he rather is the ſame to day in a more tranſcendent manner then he was yeſterday.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20.</note> For, obſerve it, he is ſaid Heb. 6.20. to be made an High Prieſt after his entry into Heaven, not that he had not been a Prieſt before for his Church; but becauſe it was never ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted in former times, as it was after his aſcenſion, when he ſhed abroad his Grace and powred down his Spirit abundantly upon his Church.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall not multiply Proofes for this out of Scripture, ſome men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having been hereof before: Take onely one inſtance, <hi>viz. Rev.</hi> 1.8.<note place="margin">

Was not the ſeventh day in the week commanded to be kept Holy to the Lord, and is it not now changed to the firſt?

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42108:135"/>charged upon him: His Covenant he doth not break, neither will he, though the form and manner of the Adminiſtration thereof be, in purſuance of it, totally varied: The ſame Salvation, on Gods part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people, he hath ſtill propounded, And the ſame termes of reconciliation with God to the Church he ſtill proclaimed, <hi>viz.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe.

                     <p>We might here ſpeak of the enlargement of the Church in this time of the Goſpel beyond the former limits, even from Sea to ſea to the uttermoſt parts of the earth, that promiſe being now fulfilled, <hi>viz That her ſeed ſhould inherit the Gentiles, and make the deſolate Cities to be inhabited,</hi> Which enlargement did neceſſarily require an abolition of thoſe rites which were affixed to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Tabernacle.</p>
                     <p>We might alſo further ſhew how the diſpenſations of grace are in great wiſdom and faith fulneſs proportioned not onely to the extent, but the age and growth of the Church; in regard whereof ſhe being not fit now to live upon carnal ordinances, as ſhe did yeſterday in her minority, was therefore to have ſtronger meat provided for her, <hi>viz.</hi> That which is more ſpiritual.</p>
                     <p>In fine, We might conſider that ſeing God doth vouchſafe his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence unto his Church in a more glorious manner, more freely, more clearly in this day of his power and grace then he hath been wont here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, eaſing his people of thoſe Yokes, which they were not able to bear, and performing the promiſes and predictions given out by his Prophets ſince the World began, it is but meet therefore that there ſhould be a removal of thoſe ſhadows that were the appendants of his former appearances, and that Memorials be kept, and Monuments ſet up of the ſeveral diſcoveries of his preſent glory.

We ſhall not need to ſeek far for our Warrant in this matter; our preſent Text will preſent it unto us: Jeſus Chriſt is the Same throughout this day of the Goſpel from the beginning to the end, The Doctrine of life which he hath delivered in the holy Scripture is ſure and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, not to be altered and revoked in the leaſt Tittle or Iota of it. <hi>It is not yea and noy</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19.) <hi>But Yea and Amen to the glory of God,</hi> ſooner will he overturn the whole frame of Nature, then alter the word that is gone out of his Lips: Whoſoever therefore they be that maintain any doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

What a maſs of Upſtart Heterodox Opinions have they forged time after time, which can never be juſtified by the everlaſting Goſpel of the Son of God? which yet notwithſtanding
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42108:136"/>are preſſed with ſo much violence, that whoſoever will not receive them, muſt be Anathematized, and perſecuted to death with fire and fagot: May we not therefore conclude that notwithſtanding all their doting pretenſions to Antiquity, they are but Novelliſts, a brood of yeſterday, and their recent inventions worthy of no value?</p>
                     <p>We deny not but where Antiquity is found in a way of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is indeed a Crown of Glory among the Churches of Chriſt. But being found in a way of Errour, wandring from the righteous rule of the written word, and laying inconſtancy upon Jeſus Chriſt (who is this way of Righteouſneſs) as if he were not the ſame ſtill in his Doctrine which he hath delivered to his Church, it is fit to be deſpiſed.</p>
                     <p>We muſt here now look to be told that the written word is not the onely rule, but that there are many other unwritten verities, to which we are likewiſe bound to give heed, as well as to that which is written.<note place="margin">Seſs. <hi>4.</hi> Decreto de Can. Script.</note> Yea and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath thundred out their Anathema againſt thoſe who refuſe Traditions for the rule of faith, as well as againſt thoſe that refuſe the written word.</p>
                     <p>But may it not then be demanded, if it be ſo, where can faith finde a ſure foundation to fix upon, that which is unwritten being very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, whether it be from Heaven or of men? If the written word be but a part of Gods revealed will, and theſe unwritten verities, as they are called, the other part, never can there be aſſurance given to any of the whole Myſtery of Salvation, neither can the Church know it aright in the whole ſeries of it, was God hath revealed it. For when ſome affirm a Tradition to be Apoſtolical, which others of as great account diſdainfully reject for a ſpurious ſuper-inducement and forgery, thruſt upon the Churches in after-times (which diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this caſe hath frequently come to paſs even in the Primitive Dayes of the Goſpel) what a miſerable maze is the faith of a believer brought into? Will not our confidences be much weakned in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual conflicts, and our hopes of gaining Converts to our Chriſtian Profeſſion from among thoſe that are without (if they ſhould make this objection unto us) be utterly choaked, and our endeavours in that kinde fruſtrated, and come to nothing? To let paſs the great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of theſe Traditions, the number of them being never yet deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, whereby they muſt needs become a great yoke and burthen to the Church of Chriſt:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</note> If that which is written be ſufficient to make

                     <p>It is not to be denied, but that the Church hath Power to appoint ſome certain Canons and Rules for the obſervation of Publick order and decency, unto which, ſo long as they are inoffenſive in their own nature, they that are true Children of the Church will give a ready and a chearful obedience: yea we do confeſs that in things indifferent a reſpect ought to be yielded to Antiquity, and to their Traditions; But if an Angel from Heaven ſhould come and tell us that all thoſe things which are ſimply neceſſary to Salvation are not to be found in the Holy Scriptures, we muſt hold him accurſed.<note place="margin">Yet <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> ſaith.

                     <p>We further do willingly grant that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles preached many things that were never written, And what they ſo preached ought to be of equal Authority with us, as that which is written, <hi>Pari veneratione, pari pietatis affictu</hi> (the very words of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> not to be diſliked) with as much Piety and Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be received by us, as the Books of Holy Scriptures, if they were as certainly known. But it is a ſtrange and ſtrong deluſion (which we hope ſhall never ſeiſe upon us) to believe that they preached do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which are a directly contrary to what is written in the ſaid Books as light is unto darkneſs. Holy and Faithful Maſter <hi>Deering</hi> in his Commentary on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expoſtulates this caſe ſadly in theſe words; Is it the word of Chriſt written that we ſhould not worſhip Angels, And is it his Word unwritten that we ſhould pray unto them? Is it his Word written that we ſhould not be bound to our Fore-Fathers Traditions, And is it his Word unwritten that our Fathers Traditions ſhould be to us as his Goſpel? Is it his word written that to forbid marriage which is honourable in all eſtates is the Doctrine of Devils, And is it his Word unwritten that Miniſters ſhould be forbidden to marry? Is it his Word written that five words in a known Tongue are better in the Congregation then five thouſand in a ſtrange Language, And is it his Word unwritten that in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations we ſhould pray in a Language which the people underſtand not? Is it his Word written that the dead are bleſſed which die in the Lord, and they reſt from their labours, And is it his Word unwritten that they are tormented in the fire of Purgatory? In ſhort, Is it his Word written that his Miniſters ſhould be ſubject to Kings, ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon their flock, and not meddle more then needs muſt with the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42108:137"/>affairs of this World, And is it his Word unwritten, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhall exerciſe Authority over Temporal powers, depoſe Kings at his pleaſure, and that his Inferiours of the Conclave ſhould be ſecular Princes? Hath God written it that Chriſt ſacrificed himſelf once for all, and made a perfect Redemption, And hath he left it unwritten that a ſhaven Prieſt muſt ſacrifice him every day, and ſay a Maſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory for the quick and dead? What perverſneſs is this of men of Corrupt minds thus to dream of Traditions contrary to the written Word of God? And what an intolerable indignity do they put upon Chriſt to make him thus palpably contradict himſelf, as if he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to be ſtill <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>But eſpecially in the high and weighty matters of Religion to be wavering and inconſtant, argues too much feebleneſs of ſpirit, unbeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thoſe that are ſeparated from the world to be the followers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the Rock of ages who never changeth.

Alas we conſider not it ſeemes what a diſhonour we bring upon our holy profeſſion, How much we grieve the ſpirit of God, nor what advantage we give unto Satan to encroach upon us, when we are not Godly and Religious in a conſtant and continued Courſe, but off and on, faſt and looſe in the Covenant of our God which we made in our Baptiſme; When with <hi>Pilate</hi> we are inquiſitive after Truth, but preſently, as he did, turn our backs upon it: ſeeme to conſult with God and his word about our ſpiritual eſtate, and in the ſame breath many times caſt him quite out of our thoughts, as if we could do well enough without him, Like unto <hi>Saul,</hi> who in all haſte calls out, <hi>Bring hither the Ark,</hi> But then, go to, it skills not greatly,<note place="margin">Socrates <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</note> carry it back again.

                     <p>Away therefore with this ſpirit of giddineſs which hath too much prevailed in theſe dayes, and let us quit our ſelves like men in being ſtill the ſame! When we have a Rock appointed for our ſtanding by the wiſdome and Faithfulneſs of the Almighty, whereon we may be ſafe againſt all the ſtormes and tempeſts of the Prince of the power of the air, ſhall we turn away from it, and in our Converſation ſwim with the ſtream of this preſent evil world, or in our judgement roll our ſelves upon the waves of new-fangled opinions, where we may be toſſed to and fro and carried about with every winde of Doctrine, and where nothing is to be expected but to be ſwallowed up at laſt in the bottomleſs gulfe of errour and confuſion? Oh ſhall we thus dally in a buſineſs of ſo great moment? Far be it from us! Rather let us Look unto JESUS, and follow his Example in being ſtill The Same.</p>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42108:138"/>ſeaſon to us of this Nation, who have not like our Pattern, been the ſame of late, what we have formerly been. We have made it our boaſt ſince we ſeparated from <hi>Rome</hi> and caſt off the Yoke of Anti-Chriſt, that we have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, profeſſing his Goſpel to be a Law unto us. But how we have walked in him, and been Obedient unto it, as we have been taught, yea taught of God in the Miniſtery of his faithful ſervants, our deeds may declare. Time was when truth was of ſo high account with us, that if it had been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible we would have plucked out our own eyes, rather then to have parted with it; But we have ſeen the time, wherein (<hi>Servis dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entibus</hi> The Lord pardon us in this) Truth was fallen in our Streets, and we have been ſuch ſtrangers unto it by giving entertainment to Errour in the moſt ugly appearances thereof, that we might well have asked, as he did, what is Truth? True it is there was a certain Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made (whether according to truth and righteouſneſs ſomewhat may be ſaid hereafter) but made I ſay for the extirpation of Hereſie and Errour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is as true which was once freely ſpoken at a Monethly-faſt in Saint <hi>Margarets Weſtminſter, If we had ſworn to the utmoſt of our power to have advanced Errour and Hereſy,</hi>

                        <hi>they could not well have grown and encreaſed more then they did, when we ſwore againſt them.</hi> There was a time alſo when we took ſweet Counſel together under the peaceful Government of a Religious King, and the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant inſpection of Grave and Orthodox Biſhops, walking to the houſe of God in company, where we had full Congregations, the office of the Miniſtery Honoured, the Word faithfully preached, Sacraments duely adminiſtred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And have not Sacraments of late been laid aſide as uſeleſs and unneceſſary, The Miniſtery cryed down as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chriſtian, Congregations ſcattered, Churches put to profane and ſordid uſes, to the ſhame of Religion, and the ſcorn of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries round about us? The Word indeed was preached, and we do with all due thankfulneſs acknowledge it to God's glory; for though ſome did preach Chriſt of envy and contention, not ſincerely, yet ſome did it of good will, and therefore <hi>ſeeing Chriſt was preached, whether in pretence or in Truth,</hi>

                        <hi>therein with</hi> St. Paul <hi>we did rejoyce yea and will rejoyce.</hi> Notwithſtanding it was both our ſin and our ſhame that that Holy and Divine Ordinance was, I ſay not with impunity, but with publick approbation ſo much profaned, when the pulpit was too often made a Tub for Mechanick praters to pour out their Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42108:139"/>or turned into a Theatre by others to promote carnal intereſts, and to ſtrengthen the Schiſme that was the ſet up: And if any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Orthodox Miniſters durſt be ſo bold according to their commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given them of Chriſt to manifeſt their zeal in preaching againſt theſe impoſtours and their abettours (as ſome there were who could not forbear) It was not their Gravity, Learning, Piety, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to their Countrey, nor ability to promote the glory of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel that could be a ſufficient ſafeguard unto them, But they muſt be branded with the odious mark of Malignancy, and even in the very execution of their office, affronted, interrupted, contradicted, yea ſometimes laughed to ſcorn: I inſtance not in particular perſons, His Majeſties gracious Act of indulgence forbidding it. But hence it was that many faithful Miniſters were ſo much deſpiſed throughout the Nation, ſometimes called Legaliſts, otherwhiles Formaliſts, yea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled with the moſt opprobrious terms that Malice it ſelf could invent. To ſome they were too plain, to others they were too eloquent, one while tax'd for not preaching Chriſt, another while for not holding forth the Doctrine of Free-grace; But if in their Sermons they happened to make mention of thoſe Holy Antients whom the Church hath honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Name of Fathers, they were preſently by ſome temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Head or other cenſured for Bablers, or at the beſt but low-ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Men, that would be padling in the ſhallows of Antiquity, not fit forſooth to be named with the profound knowledge of theſe dayes. So imperious were people grown in their ſuperintendency over their Teachers; yea though they were illiterate Mechanicks, yet being the Darlings of the Schiſme, they would preſume, as being allowed to be Dictatours to the moſt grave and learned Miniſters that were not of their Faction, not conſidering what the Apoſtle ſaith, that The ſpirits of the prophets are ſubject to the Prophets, implying doubtleſs, that it is the Eccleſiaſtical Senate that ſhould take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of Preachers Doctrines, ſo as to regulate whatſoever may be found amiſs in them, not the Company of ſpear-men, or calves of the people, as the Prophet calleth the rude malitude. But ſuch was the impiety of thoſe times, that the poor Miniſters of Chriſt (though by the Holy Ghoſt accounted the Prime <hi>Maſters of the Aſsemblies</hi>) did commonly ſtand in their Pulpits like Priſoners at the Bar when their Hearers,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Again, As preaching was prophaned, ſo in like manner was prayer too much perverted and depraved. Whereas in our approaches to God we were wont to fall down upon our knees, adoring the Divine Majeſty with the humbling of our bodies to the very duſt, according to the religious example of the devout ſervants of God in Scripture,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.41. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39.</note> yea of the Son of God himſelf, of whom Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, that <hi>He kneeled and prayed,</hi> Saint <hi>Mark</hi> that <hi>he fell to the ground and prayed,</hi> Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> that <hi>he fell upon his face and prayed,</hi> What an Unreverend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency hath the late times produced, when this humble geſture was in many places wholly neglected, as being forſooth below the Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of our Upſtart Reformers, who poſſibly might pretend to have more familiaritie with the God of Heaven, then thoſe could be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have, that had been before them; And therefore they might now ſerve him without fear, though the truth is, they did it not in righteouſneſs nor true holineſs. Was not the ſpiritualneſs of prayer confined to the ſuddenneſs of conception, and volubility of utterance (qualities not incompoſſible with a ſpirit of oppoſition to all that is good and holy) which alſo were accompanied too frequently (it is to be feared) with a vain oſtentation of mens abilities for invention, and with ſuch expreſſions many times that no honeſt heart God knoweth could ſay Amen unto them; When a Set-form though compiled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the warrant and pattern that Chriſt hath given us, and uſed with a pious and ſincere devotion, was (contrary to the rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity, contrary to the judgement of the beſt Divines, both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and Modern, forein and domeſtick, yea, contrary to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral practice of the Reformed Churches) condemned and rejected as unſutable to the ſpirit of Adoption, and unacceptable to the God of Heaven, as if the Almighty were more to be taken with the variety of words, then with the groans of the ſpirit, which may aſſoon aſcend up into his ears in the Religious uſe of a form, as in the uttering of the beſt conceived prayer in the World. But it is no marvel that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms of prayer were ſo much decryed, when the Lords prayer it ſelf was ſleighted, yea ſo deſpiſed, that if according to the good antient Cuſtome among us, prayers were concluded with a rehearſal of it, Such was the horrible profaneſs of ſome (who yet pretended to a Seraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſtrain of Holineſs above others) that they would thereupon moſt unreverendly in the face of the Congregation put their hats on their heads, that they might thereby throw contempt upon that prayer,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42108:140"/>and thoſe that uſed it. Which diſdainful poſture, if they did at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it lawful and ſit to be uſed in ſo ſolemn a matter as the ſervice of God, would have been more tolerable at thoſe times, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived prayer it ſelf was diſhonoured by the Plagiary ſuper-induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of other mens labours, ſurreptitiouſly taken out of their printed Books, and under a pretence of ſuddenneſs of Conception frequently and at large thruſt into Publick prayers even by thoſe that were the greateſt enemies to common and publick forms. Sundry other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might here be reckoned up, whereby it would appear that there was not any thing wherein the Beauty of Holineſs had ſhined out in former times that was not wofully polluted in thoſe dayes of Schiſm by our Changings and Counter-changings, which were ſuch that it might well be ſaid of us, notwithſtanding all our vain-glorious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to a glorious light ſurpaſſing all that had been ſeen in the Ages before, that indeed and in truth we feared not God: Alas our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was our ſhame, and we like a fooliſh people and unwiſe, loved to have it ſo, accounting that which was indeed our ſhame to be our greateſt glory.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>non fuit ſic ab initio,</hi> It was not wont to be thus. We had left our firſt love and zeal for the truth of the Goſpel, and therefore did God in his juſt judgment give us up to ſtrong deluſions to follow after lies. High time then was it for us to repent and do our firſt Works, and to ſay with thoſe in the Prophet, we will go and return to our firſt husband, for then was it better with us then now. The ſtreets of Romiſh <hi>Askelon</hi> poſſibly may ring of theſe our miſ-doings, and the rather becauſe we are not quite gone over unto them, when we were brought very near: But they may ſpare their breath to remove their own ſtench, if they can, which is ſo noiſome all the world over. We will our ſelves give glory to God in confeſſing that our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions have been many, and our back-ſlidings have encreaſed. Our ſinful compliancy with Anabaptiſme, Browniſme, Familiſme <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in former times were judged by us, according to their proper nature, to be moſt abominable Errours, hath been ſo notorious that it doth even fill our faces with ſhame and bluſhing, when we ſadly take it into our conſideration, that we whom God have made a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to be deſpiſed, but honourable in the eye of the World, and a Church adorned with a glorious beauty ſurmounting other Churches
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42108:140"/>even by their own confeſsion, yea terrible as an Army with Banners to Anti-Chriſt and his Adherents, ſhould make our ſelves thus naked and bare by entertaining ſuch ſcurfe into our boſome which was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rather to be trod under foot. Surely very unworthy have we hereby made our ſelves of that dignity which God hath put upon us.</p>
                     <p>True it is this miſcheivous project was firſt hatched and afterwards fomented by ſome falſe brethren among us, the ſpurious iſſue of <hi>John</hi> a <hi>Leyden</hi> and <hi>Knipperdolling,</hi> yet becauſe it did prevail and grew to ſuch a height without any the leaſt control from thoſe that had power in their hands to ſuppreſs it, to whom the Nation did generally in a manner ſubmit, the guilt therefore of a moſt ſhameful Apoſtacy might too juſtly we fear be imputed unto us.</p>
                     <p>But rejoyce not againſt us O our enemy, though we have fallen, we are through mercy riſen again, &amp; though our backſlidings have been ſtrong yet they are not (bleſſed for ever and ever be the Name of our God) either like unto thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> perpetual. If we have through the ſly inſinuations of <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Emiſſaries, who have min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled themſelves with us in the late Tranſactions of our nation, and the cunning craftineſs of Hypocritical ſelf-ſeekers, been too raſh and heady in endeavouring to amend what was judged to be amiſs in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God, we will not when God hath ſhewed us our Errour be pertinacious in it; but return rather to our Obedience from which we have ſwerved, and be better adviſed hereafter, waiting upon the Lord in his own way for the propagating of his Goſpel as his word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſhall direct us. In the mean time we will not ſpare to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh our ſorrow for thoſe deplorable waſtes which our inadvertency hath brought upon this poor yet excellent Church of Chriſt. Too excellent indeed to be the Mother of ſuch unnatural, fooliſh and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Children, as we have been unto her; Who though ſhe be comely in the eyes of her Beloved, and in the eyes of all the daughters of his people in the world about her, yet wo unto us we have black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her with the ſpots of our Diviſions, and brought a cloud over all her excellencies. Surely this is a Lamentation and muſt be for a Lamentation.</p>
                     <p>But what then would ſome ſay, would you have us now to relinquiſh that glorious Cauſe which with a Solemn League and Covenant we
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42108:141"/>have undertaken to maintain; and return again to profaneſs and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition? what were this but to deal falſely in the Covenant of our God, and to draw the guilt of odious inconſtancy upon us? It will become us rather according to your former admonition, herein to be ſtill the Same, and to follow the example of thoſe reſolute and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Martyrs who of late to the very death perſiſted in the juſtifying of ſo good a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Now unto this Objection it will be requiſite to give a full and clear reſolution, to the end that it may be made evident who thoſe are among us that come neereſt to the pattern here preſented in the Text in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill the ſame, whether thoſe that object theſe things, accuſing their brethren of I know not what ſinful temporizing and tergiverſation for not joyning with them in endeavouring to root up the foundation of this Change which the Divine Providence hath brought upon this Nation, or thoſe that are thus accuſed, who upon convictions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are neceſſitated with the whole ſtrength of their ſouls to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and give furtherance unto it.</p>
                     <p>In the treating of this ſubject, though I queſtion not but ſome will be apt to quarrel at my plain dealing, yet I ſhall without upbraiding any particular perſons, labour as in the preſence of God to give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to thoſe Conſciences that in truth deſire to be reſolved concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the warrantableneſs of ſubmitting to this Change in returning to our obedience, And ſhall inſert nothing, but for what I ſhall be willing to be reſponſal to any who ſhall rationally require an account of me.</p>
                     <p>To begin then with the Cauſe, as it was called, and a Glorious Cauſe, What was it? It was pretended at firſt that great matters ſhould be done for the King, People, and Religion, The King ſhould be made a great and glorious Prince, The People ſhould have their juſt liberties reſtored unto them, Religion ſhould be eſtabliſhed, and ſet free from the invaſion of all Hereſies and Errours wherewith it was before corrupted, All which being done we ſhould finde our ſelves the happieſt Nation upon earth, and Glory ſhould dwell in our Land. Unto this plauſible ſound did multitudes of well-meaning people in the ſimplicity of their hearts give an attentive Ear, and were allured to contribute their aſſiſtance to the carrying on of ſo good a work. But if this were the Cauſe that was ſo much cryed up and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42108:141"/>for which the Land was filled with violence from one end to the other, How came it to paſs that it fell ſo foulely as it did? Who was it that hindered the progreſs of it? Was it not they that abſurdly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſtil an adherency unto it, when a ſword by their means hath paſſed through the Soul of it? Is not their Hypocriſie, Double dealing, Self-ſeeking, Treachery in the whole managery of this buſineſs diſcovered plainly in the face of all Mankinde? Certainly ſhould all Hiſtories be ſearched, there could not be found a more palpable Cheat put upon a Nation ſince the beginning of the World: The publick faith of the Kingdom to aſſure the Reallity of theſe pretenſes was through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of a ſort of Traitours to God, their King and their Countrey, frequently turned into publick fraud. Yea the faith of the Goſpel was made a Cloak to cover the corrupt projects of ſelf-ended Men. Nothing done of all that was promiſed, but rather very much clean contrary; Confuſion and Diſorder brake in upon us like a Deluge and there was no viſible remedy in the apprehenſion of all Unbiaſſed men, but a ſwift and overſpreading deſolation muſt needs have fallen upon the whole Land. All which conſidered, To make boaſt ſtill of a Cauſe, wherewith they dealt ſo perfidiouſly, and of which God in his juſt indignation, for the Corruptions both in the birth and growth of it, hath ſaid it ſhall not ſtand, making it a <hi>Nehuſhtan,</hi> doth it not argue a fighting againſt God, and a deſign to be ſtill the Same rather in a treachery which all the Chriſtian world cryeth ſhame upon, then in any thing wherein the glory of God, or the ſafety of their Countrey might be concern'd?</p>
                     <p>As for the League and Covenant (called in ſcorn the Legal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant even by thoſe who do now plead it) it was indeed brought on to add a ſeeming ſtrength to the ſaid Cauſe, and the better to draw inconſiderate people to joyn in the purſuance of it. But there are many unanſwerable reaſons to be heeded that do clearly ſhew the nullity thereof, which being exactly related by others, we ſhall not need to inſiſt upon them here. Somewhat notwithſtanding ſhall be here added to give ſatisfaction in this particular. It is well known that to incline people to the taking of the Covenant (that is, to take the Whip with ſix cords (as the ſix Articles in K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eights time was called) to ſcourge and torment their Conſciences with) ſome uſe was made of that Reſtriction in the firſt Article of it; <hi>viz.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word of God, being interpreted by the politick Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42108:142"/>of thoſe dayes, as a Proviſo, whereby an Out-let was ſet for any to recede from the Obſervation of it, if afterwards upon better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration they found it to be otherwiſe then it was repreſented unto them. But what vile Hypocriſie was this, to lead poor people into a ſnare by ſuch tricks of Legerdemain? Nay is it not an impious Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery of the Holy Ghoſt thus to make the Word, which is the Oracle of the moſt High God, a ſtale to the politick Intereſts of wretched men? For, as it is well obſerved, upon the ſame account we may ſubſcribe to the Council of Trent, yea to the Turkiſh Alcoran, ſwearing to maintain and defend either of them, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo far as they are agreeable to the Word of God. But much better ſurely may we now make the ſaid Reſtriction our Warrant totally to cancel that Covenant by a godly ſorrow, and ſerious lamentation for it, finding it in ſundry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects different from that Righteous Rule, according to which all our Actions are to be ſquared. For in ſuch caſes that golden Axiom muſt be our Guide, <hi>viz. Poenitenda Promiſſio, non perficienda Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptio,</hi> The Covenant muſt be retracted by Repentance, not the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption heightened by Continuance.</p>
                     <p>As for the Illegality of it throughout, from firſt to laſt, our Famous and Renowned Univerſity of Oxford hath with a general Conſent in a full Convocation very plainly and faithfully diſcovered it to the ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of all Gain-ſayers,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>June</hi> 1. 1647.</note> and to their everlaſting Honour before God and Man. Unto whoſe cleer Argutations I remit all men that are in a capacity to receive ſatisfaction in this point, and to be convinced with Reaſon: Concluding with the Caſuiſt, <hi>Ne ſit Sacramentum pietatis, impedimentum pietatis, nec vinculum iniquitatis,</hi> Let not a pious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation be a bar to piety, nor a bond of iniquity.</p>
                     <p>Whereas it is ſaid next, that by Deſerting the Cauſe we ſhall return again to Profaneſs and Superſtition, I anſwer, God forbid! Rather it is to be hoped that an unanimous Agreement in rooting up the ſaid pretended Cauſe, would be the ready way to remove that Profaneſs and Superſtition which have provoked Gods diſpleaſure againſt us. But let it be conſidered, What returning to profaneſs can there be now more then the Land was polluted with in the time of the late Schiſme, when the Name of God was diſhonoured by Swearing and Forſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt neglected, yea deſpiſed, Gods faithful Miniſters cruelly mocked and derided; In a word, When ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity did ſo much abound, (though it muſt be confeſſed it aboundeth
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42108:142"/>ſtill too much amongſt us, even in theſe dayes of our Deliverance) that ſcarce any poſterity ſhall be able to add thereunto? And as for Superſtition, which the Holy Scripture calls <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, Fear of falſe Daemons, rather then of the true God, What can be greater then that which hath been already ſet up and ſpread about the Nation by our Sectarian Seminaries, Independents, Anabaptiſts, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians, Seekers, Quakers, and the reſt of that Rabble, who have notwithſtanding the ſtruglings of God and Man upon their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, been like a company of Superſtitious Dotards, ſo mad upon their Idols, I mean their Squint eyed, Wry-necked, Double-tongued, Snivelling Daemons of Horrid and Monſtrous Opinions, and wherein they continue to this very day, that it is a manifeſt token, as one ſaid not amiſs, They are errour-blaſted both from Heaven and Hell. Nay more, Was there ever ſuch a cloſe and cunning Connivence afforded, ſince the Reformation began in this Nation, to Romiſh Superſtitions, then was under the Regency of the ſaid Cauſe? The great Projectour, or at leaſt Protractour, thereof himſelf, who made England to ſin, obſerving in one of his Proclamations (though nevertheleſs it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that alſo Tolerated) that Multitudes of Jeſuits and Popiſh Prieſts did reſort unto and remain within this Common-wealth and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions thereunto belonging,<note place="margin">

If then that Cauſe ſo much pleaded for, had ſuch ill Conſequents attending upon it, may we not well ſay, <hi>Sublatâ Cauſâ tollitur Effectus;</hi> When the Cauſe is taken away, the Effect will follow?</p>
                     <p>At leaſt as I ſaid before there is great hope it ſhall follow, eſpecially now when God hath in Mercy ſet over us a Man of Underſtanding and Knowledge,<note place="margin">

A Man I ſay after his own heart, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour'd and Bred up by him like <hi>David</hi> in the ſchool of affliction, Whoſe Heart is alſo fixed upon God to ſerve him in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs; A Prince ſo pious that he makes it his work, and accounts it his glory to have true Religion eſtabliſhed amongſt his people in the Power and Purity of it:<note place="margin">See his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, <hi>May</hi> 30. 1660.</note> Witneſs his extreme diſlike of Profaneſs, which he haſted to publiſh the very next day after his happy Return unto us, Commanding it to be read in all Churches monethly for ſix

Requiring all Majors, Sheriffs, and Juſtices of the Peace to be very vigilant and ſtrict in the Diſcovery and Proſecution of all Diſſolute and Profane Perſons, ſuch as blaspheme the Name of God by profane ſwearing and curſing, or revile and diſturb Miniſters, and despiſe the publick worſhip of God.</hi> Witneſs alſo the Declaration which his Majeſty ſet forth (<hi>Octob.</hi> 25, immediately following) concerning Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, wherein he hath made known to God and the world, That <hi>his Reſolution is and ſhall be to promote the Power of Godlineſs, to encourage the Exerciſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion both publick and private, and to take care that the Lords Day be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Holy Exerciſes without unneceſſary divertiſements, and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, Negligent, and Scandalous Miniſters be not permitted in the Church.</hi> Which being ſo, What is it but a profane ſlander of the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of Gods Anointed, both of Chriſt himſelf, and his Vicegerent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, to amuſe the world with falſe reports of a return to profaneſs, as if the Times were now become ſo looſe, that Wickedneſs ſhould be eſtabliſhed by a Law? Whereas there was never more likelihood then now (if the Devil through the turbulent ſpirits of factious Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks did not hinder it) for Religion to proſper, and Holineſs to flouriſh.</p>
                     <p>Away then with Profaneſs, and let Superſtition pack together with it; for what entertainment is it like here to finde, When <hi>King Charls the Sufferer,</hi>

                        <hi>the ſonne of King Charls the Martyr</hi> (as a Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Church hath worthily proclaimed him) <hi>is new by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power and Goodneſs ſettled upon his Throne,</hi> to be the Defender of that Faith for which he ſuffered? That Faith I ſay, which the Church of England profeſſeth in oppoſition to the Church of Rome, From which (as it was obſerved by that Loyal and Peace-making Parliament, that firſt ſo happily brought the Nation under his Majeſties Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>neither the Temptation of Allurements, Perſwaſions and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from ſeducing Papists on the one hand, nor the Perſecution and hard <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage from ſome ſeduced and miſ-guided Profeſſours of the Proteſtant Religion on the other hand, could at all prevail upon him to make him

I ſay then again, Is it like, that Superſtition in any kinde ſhould be Tolerated (much leſs ſhall it be Eſtabliſhed) under the Government of ſo famous a Sufferer for the Proteſtant Profeſſion, yea and ſo active a Defender of it, who hath made it manifeſt that his Care and Study is for the propagation thereof, And who hath ſolemnly profeſſed that nothing ſhall be propoſed to teſtifie his Zeal and Affection for it, to which he will not readily conſent?</p>
                     <p>It will be objected, What do we hear Words, when we ſee Deeds? Is there not an Actual return to Superſtition in this Land now, when the Ceremonies which were caſt out are brought in again, and the Liturgie reſtored? And what are theſe, but either the Iſſues of Will-worſhip which the Holy Scripture doth condemn, or the Bratts of Babylon which ſhould be taken not to be cheriſht, but to be daſht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtones? Beſides, Is not the Government alſo by Biſhops ſet up again in its former Height, which is not warranted by the word of God? If we then ſhould conſent to theſe things, How ſhall we like unto Jeſus Chriſt our Pattern in the Text continue faithful with God in our Conformity to his Rule which he hath ſet us?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, Firſt we may be ſtill the ſame in a conſtant Adherency to the Foundation, though we may as Divine Providence leads us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in Judgment or in Mercy, vary ſometimes from that which is Circumſtantial (of which nature are thoſe things that are here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected unto us) and our fidelity to the former wil certainly entitle us to a faithful Imitation of Jeſus Chriſt, notwithſtanding our change in the latter. Nay, is it not a great weakning of the Foundation, and an injurious imputation put upon the Maſter-Builder, to lay ſo much weight upon Circumſtantials, as to make them Unchangeable when they are not of his particular appointment, though allowed by him to be annexed to his Building? It is Superſtition doubtleſs ſo to ſet up External Rites in competition with the Everlaſting Rule of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as if they were not upon any Emergency whatſoever to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered or removed.

But we may appeal unto Chriſt himſelf to Judge in this Caſe, Whether or no, when a Chriſtian Magiſtrate that truly feareth God, taking notice of a great decay of Religion, which by a wild and lawleſs Liberty hath been brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Subjects, ſhall for the improvement of Piety recommend unto them a Form of Divine Service accompanied with ſuch Rites and Ceremonies as are in force by Law, and in the obſerving whereof True Religion hath formerly flouriſhed, Whether, I ſay it be Superſtition in them to joyn with him in the Obſervation thereof, eſpecially when they are few in number, no merit placed in them, nor are they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be obſerved as things neceſſary to ſalvation, or as parts of Gods worſhip which under pain of Damnation ought to be uſed, nor as ſigns operative, working Grace in thoſe that make conſcience of them; but are expreſly declared to be indifferent in their own nature, and that upon juſt cauſes they may be altered and changed; In ſo much that if the Supreme Magiſtrate ſhall again forbid the uſe of the ſaid Service and Ceremonies, the people may without ſin lay them aſide, yea are bound in Conſcience ſo to do, and obſerve others (provided that they have the ſame premiſed Boundaries) which he ſhall command. All which conſidered, Who ſeeth not how unjuſtly we are accuſed of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition in the Service of our God, becauſe of our religious uſing of ſome few harmleſs Ceremonies, without which our late Experience may ſufficiently teach us, that Religion it ſelf would not long ſtand in ſafety, but by degrees be totally laid waſte? <hi>Ego certe illas veneror, &amp; tantae pietati ſemper aſſurgo,</hi> for my part I ſhall, notwithſtanding the Oggannition of gain-ſayers, highly eſteem them, and commend the obſervation of them to all who are willing to advance the Kingdome of the Lord Jeſus.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42108:145"/>conceive may ſomewhat ſtop the mouth of Contradition againſt the holy and religious cuſtom of our Church in requiring all perſons to Bow at the Name of Jeſus, for ſhe hath learned it of the Father (whoſe example is withuot controverſie in this caſe worthy of all imitation) to exalt him, becauſe for our ſake he made himſelf of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Again, Is not our Lord now (as it hath been prophecied of him <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.3.) deſpiſed and rejected of men? Do not Jews, Turks, and Infidels blaſpheme that worthy name, by which we are called? Are not Socinians thoſe curſed Hereticks as unwearied now in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt him, to lay his honour in the duſt, as the Arians were of old? Is not the precious Bloud of this Immaculate Lamb of God, ſhed to take away the ſin of the World, every where almoſt, beſlaver'd with the impious mouthes of execrable ſwearers? And are there not ſome wretched people riſen up amongſt us in theſe days, who out of a Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferian Pride, pretend that they are as well and as truly God, as Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they have their Being in God, and are partakers of the Divine Nature? What then ſhould the Church do, but out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of theſe horrid impieties, and out of a tender regard to the honour of her Lord, give a ſignal teſtimony of her duty, in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all her faithful children to bow their bodies in token of reverence unto him, at the mentioning of his Name? That Name, I ſay, which ſounds the ſweeteſt in the ears and hearts of poor penitent ſinners, which ſpeaks him not onely to be <hi>Inmanuel,</hi> God with us, but <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu</hi> (as the rapture of our admired Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> diſtinguiſheth it) With us, or, One of us, bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh, which hath been the occaſion that his enemies have laid hold upon, to make light account of him. But enough of this.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid alſo that our bowing the body at our Entrance into the Congregation, and Departure from it, is Superſtition. In anſwer hereunto (to add ſomewhat likewiſe to that which hath been written by others) If this be Superſtition, we may juſtly retort it upon the common practice of Non-conformiſts themſelves in their private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where they uſe at their riſing up from their Devotions, to bow their bodies to one another, pretending, as it hath been ſaid by ſome of their principal leaders, that it is a laudable cuſtom among them,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42108:145"/>for that they do thereby teſtifie their unanimity in the ſervice of God, and mutually witneſs their gratitude for their mutual praying for one another. Thus plauſibly can they pleaſe themſelves with Apologies for what they act of this nature among themſelves in private, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſcruple at all of conſcience, and yet uncharitably condemn the Churches order for doing the very ſame thing in publick to the ſame good ends and purpoſes amongſt many other, as if their private Incurvations were more warrantable from the word of God, then our publick Genu-flexions: Certainly as publick prayers are more acceptable unto God then private, ſo publick reverence in the place and time of Gods Worſhip and Service will better become us, and more adorn our Chriſtian Profeſſion, then any thing can of that kinde in private whatſoever. It is uſual amongſt us, for men in token of reverence, to be uncovered, when they enter into the Congregation, and it is generally look'd upon as a bold impiety, if any ſhould be ſo voyd of ſhame, as to preſume to do otherwiſe. Judge then whether it be not as lawful to bend the knee, or bow the body, as to uncover the head, in ſuch a time and place, ſince thoſe geſtures are more ſolemnly reverential then this, and the more reverence we uſe that is ſutable to the quality of the ſervice we are about, the more comely (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) is it in the ſight of God and man.</p>
                     <p>Our bleſſed Saviour would have his Diſciples, when they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an houſe, to ſalute it, And if the Sonne of Peace were there, to let their peace at their departure reſt upon it: How much more then when we enter into, and depart from the houſe of God (for ſuch are our Churches, notwithſtanding the malicious prating of profane ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, as well as the Synagogues of old were amongſt the Jews) ſhould we ſhew the affection of our hearts towards it by the geſture of our bodies? Eſpecially when we know that it is the Tabernacle of Meeting between God and his people? Shall our God then, the God of love and peace, be there, and we not aware of it? And ſhall his people there aſſemble together, in obedience to his Command, To adore his goodneſs, To praiſe his name, To hear his word, To receive his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, To teſtifie their faith, To pour out their requeſts, To joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a holy communion as becometh members of one and the ſame myſtical body, And ſhould not we be ready, as thoſe that are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the ſame obedience, at our Entrance among them, and Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from them, to give teſtimony, by the bowing of our bodies, of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42108:146"/>the bending of our ſouls to the ſame ſervice, and of our cordial rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at our fellowſhip with them therein?</p>
                     <p>Nay more, Are the glorious Angels there preſent (as the holy Scriture once and again hinteth unto us they are) deſiring to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our manner of the publick ſervice of our God, and willing to be our guardians in it, And ſhould not we from firſt to laſt ſo demean our ſelves therein, with a reſpect unto their preſence, that they may rejoyce to behold their God and our God worſhipped on earth, as he is in heaven, according to our capacities, with reverence and godly fear? Surely, If theſe things were conſidered aright as they ought to be, they that have hitherto been ſo ſtiff in their prejudices againſt, the holy Church, for requiring theſe externall Genu-flexions, would be more flexible then they have been: They would not ſay, It ſufficeth that our hearts are right towards God, though we do not ſhew it, and becauſe God requireth truth in the inward parts, Therefore, it is enough that we do with our ſouls love the aſſemblies of Gods people, and delight in the Law of our God in the inward man, thereby think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to palliate their want of reverence which is due to God and his Church. But the wiſdome of the Wiſe checks them for this their folly, telling them that open rebuke is better then ſecret love.</p>
                     <p>This by the way in the vindication of the Order of our Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe two particular Ceremonies. Let us now proceed more generally as we began, in anſwer to the before-mentioned Objection.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Admit that it was Will-worſhip which brought on thoſe Ceremonies and Liturgy at firſt, and hath now reſtored them, yet it wil not follow that they therefore are ſuperſtitious; For what is that <gap reason="foreign">

Let the place be conſulted, and we ſhall finde, that the Apoſtle there joyns <hi>Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with humility and beating down or mortifying of the Body;</hi> both which are required in thoſe that will be Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt;<note place="margin">

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42108:146"/>that is pretended to be in them, to have a ſhew or pretext of wiſdom, that is, of true ſpiritual wiſdom, otherwiſe what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage would the ſhew be unto them? And can any thing be ſaid to have a ſhew or ſhine of ſuch wiſdom in Will-worſhip, if all kinde of Will-worſhip be in it ſelf ſinful? Hypocrites make a ſhew of Holineſs, and falſe Prophets will make a ſhew of Truth,<note place="margin">Zach. <hi>13.4.</hi>

So thoſe Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have been and are again in uſe amongſt us (I mean ſuch as are eſtabliſhed by law) may indeed be ſaid to be a Will-worſhip, wherein we in this time of the Goſpel ſhould rather excell thoſe before us under the Law, then to come ſhort of them) But to ſay that they are therefore Superſtitious, that is, Anti-Chriſtian and Idolatrous, as ſome are apt moſt profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to traduce them, is a Soloeciſme proper for thoſe that are enemies unto reaſon.</p>

                     <p>Nevertheleſs though our Form of Divine Service and Ceremonies be a Will-worſhip, yet we ſhall ever deny that they ſprung out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is, according to the ſenſe of theſe quarrelſome people, that we received them from <hi>Rome.</hi> It is the Lot it ſeemes of this poor Church of Chriſt, to have this Croſs laid upon her, <hi>viz.</hi> to be on all ſides upbraided ſtill with <hi>Rome,</hi> Papiſts on the one hand checking us, that the firſt Plantation of the Goſpel here came from thence, and that therefore we are unnatural Children to ſeparate our ſelves as we do, from our Mother that gave us our being: Schiſmaticks on the other hand charging us that we have not, as we pretend, ſeparated from that Idolatrous Church, but to this very day do hold too ſervile a compliancy with it, crying out againſt us with open mouth, as is the Mother, ſo is the Daughter, <hi>Rome</hi> like a falſe Strumpet hath devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Superſtitious Form of Religious Worſhip, and <hi>England</hi> like a true Chip of the old Block doth follow her example therein: But as Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> once gave the ſenſe of thoſe four famous and ſolemne Letters <hi>S.

                     <p>As to the firſt of theſe reproaches, if it were not out of our way, we might reply, that ſuppoſing (not granting) it to be true, The people of this Nation received the Chriſtian Faith from <hi>Rome,</hi> We hold not our ſelves obliged thereby, to follow <hi>Rome</hi> any otherwiſe then ſhe followeth Chriſt, for we have learned it from the mouth of our Lord himſelf, that who ſo loveth Father or Mother more then him, is not worthy of him. But what Logick is this? The Planters of the Faith here came from <hi>Rome, Ergo,</hi> the people of this Nation were ever after in the worſhipping of God to keep the Order of <hi>Rome?</hi> If this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would hold (ſaith Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi>) then would I reaſon thus; <hi>The Church of Rome was firſt planted by them that came from Graecia or from Jeruſalem, Ergo, Rome is to keep the Order of Graecia or of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi> which conſequence I dare ſay will not down with her that takes upon her to be perpetual Dictatrix to all the Churches of the world.</p>
                     <p>But we ſhall let this paſs as impertinent to our purpoſe, neither is there need at any time to inſiſt much upon it; for it is ſufficiently wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed (ſaith Biſhop <hi>Godwin</hi>) by many Hiſtories without exception, that our Iſland of <hi>Britain</hi> received the Faith of Chriſt, even in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the Church, from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> That which is now before us is to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42108:147"/>make manifeſt the folly of theſe Schiſmatical Objectours, who accuſe us of Superſtition in our Church-Service, becauſe, as they ſay, we received it from <hi>Rome.</hi> It would be too large a digreſsion here to undertake a Vindication of our Church in every particular that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns this matter (enough hath been written thereof already by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry perſons both Learned and Godly whoſe works praiſe them in the gates) yet requiſite it is that ſomewhat be here added to wipe off that aſperſion before premiſed, which may be reduced to this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whatſoever Church hath received her forme of Divine-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from <hi>Rome,</hi> is therein guilty of groſs Superiſtition: But the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath received her form of Divine-Service from <hi>Rome:</hi> therefore is the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the form of Divine-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice guilty of groſs Superſtition.</p>
                     <p>We will not meddle with the propoſition of this argument, Let <hi>Rome</hi> plead for her ſelf againſt it: But as for the aſſumption we ſhall by clear and plain demonſtration prove that to be utterly falſe, both in reſpect of the times of old, as alſo of the later, ſince the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Reformation.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, We may here by the way upon very good warrant affirm, that <hi>Non fuit ſic ab initio,</hi> It was not wont to be thus with <hi>England</hi> in the times of old, <hi>viz.</hi> To follow <hi>Rome</hi> in the forme of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The reaſon of our confidence herein, we have from that vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Authour our Country-man before mentioned, who is by all parties acknowledged to be a faithful Witneſs worthy of an high eſteem in the Church, Hee I ſay in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory informes us<note place="margin">Beda <hi>lib.</hi> 3 <hi>cap.</hi> 25.</note> that the Church of this Iſland of <hi>Britain</hi> well near until ſeven hundred years after Chriſt, in the keeping of <hi>Eaſter</hi>-day and manner of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing, followed the order of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, without any regard therein had to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And when <hi>Auſtin</hi> that impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Monk was ſent hither from <hi>Rome,</hi> And when <hi>Auſtin</hi> that impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Monk was ſent hither from <hi>Rome,</hi> here were ſaith <hi>Bede</hi> at that time one Arch-Biſhop, ſeven Biſhops,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note> and one and twenty hundred holy and religious Monks about <hi>Bangor,</hi> who lived by the labour of their own hands, the Countrey being for the moſt part Heatheniſh, and as he further avoucheth, <hi>plures viri doctiſſimi,</hi> many moe great learned men that utterly refuſed to receive any <hi>Roman</hi> orders or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes from the ſaid <hi>Auſtin</hi> in the Service of God, though he urged them thereunto by many terrible threats. Again Sain <hi>Gregory</hi> being then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, none of all his ſucceſſours
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42108:148"/>were for Holineſs and Learning worthy to be compared with him, when he had ſent this <hi>Auſtin</hi> hither to preach the Goſpel he gave him his inſtructions in this manner. <hi>Where you finde any thing that ſeemeth ☞ better to the Service of God then is in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>Chooſe you the ſame, and do your endeavour to bring into the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Church the beſt and choiceſt things, Chooſe out of many Churches, for things are not to be loved for the place ſake, but the place is to be loved for the things that are good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By theſe inſtances it may appear that this Church in thoſe dayes did not in their publick ſervice of God conform to the order of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither did that Church impoſe any ſuch order up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
                     <p>In proceſs of time indeed it came to paſs that there were ſundry Orders came here into uſe, eſpecially that of <hi>Sarum</hi> compiled by <hi>Oſmund</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> which continued for above five hundred years till the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth. In all which time the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtitions in Divine worſhip were too much obtruded upon the people of this Nation: But thoſe times of darkneſs are not within the verge of this Vindication.</p>
                     <p>But for our preſent Liturgy which hath been eſtabliſhed ſince the Reformation, that it ſhould be originally taken out of the ſaid Miſſal, and conſequently tranſmitted to us from <hi>Rome</hi> as they would make us believe, is clearly as manifeſt an Untruth, as that we have originally received our Religion from <hi>Rome.</hi> True it is that that breviary, as it is called, <hi>ſecundum Salisburienſis Eccleſiae uſum,</hi> doth agree in ſome things with our Liturgy: But it will not therefore follow that our Liturgy is a poor puiſne extract taken out of it. Sober and diſcreet men would rather infer thereupon that our Liturgy, and as much of that <hi>Popiſh</hi> Portifory as is incorrupt, are taken out of the Primitive Chriſtian Liturgies, which were devoutly uſed in ſeveral Churches perſecuted for the faith of Chriſt long before any <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtitions were in Being; whereunto if there be with us a holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Conformity to ſhew that we are in communion and fellowſhip with that poor perſecuted Church of old, that was valiant for the Truth, reſiſting the enemies of Chriſt even unto bloud, and upon whoſe unwearied labours and ſufferings we are happily entred, What offenſe is it?</p>
                     <p>Now that our Liturgy is ſuch we might alledge the faithfulneſs of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42108:148"/>the Compilers of it, who according to the truſt repoſed in them (as maſter <hi>Fox</hi> reports it in his Martyrology) had in this important bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs as well an eye and reſpect unto the moſt ſincere and pure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion taught by the Holy Scriptures, as alſo to the uſages of the Primitive Church; which the Act of Parliament made for the Confirmation of it, atteſteth in theſe words,<note place="margin">5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>of</hi> Ed. 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> 
                        <hi>The Common Prayer eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law in</hi> England <hi>is agreeable to the word of God, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church:</hi> And as the King, a Zealous and Religious Prince to ſatisfie ſome of his mutinous Subjects about it, ſaith, <hi>It is altered from that the Popes of</hi> Rome <hi>for their lacre brought it unto.</hi>

Thirdly that there were ſome ſpecial times of the year as appears by the inſtance of our Saviours Paſſion wherein they had their Forms proper for thoſe times. Fourthly (which is the cauſe of the inſerting of this Story) the manner of their worſhipping God, and the very ſubject matter of their Forms were taken up and continued by the Church in the following ages.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore it will be requiſite that an apologie be premiſed and admitted, which is this, It is not to be expected that the whole Frame of our Liturgy ſhould be found in thoſe Hiſtorians and others that have written of the Church in the Primitive times. The diſpenſations of Gods providence towards his people are much varied now from thoſe of old, and therefore we are not obliged preciſely to follow their exemplar in the whole Form of any of their Liturgies, but are to make our Supplications according to the preſent ſtate and exigency of the Church wherein we are concern'd. They prayed heretofore <hi>pro mora finis,</hi> That the final conſummation of all things might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, becauſe, as it is ſuppoſed, they were afraid to come under the tyranny of Antichriſt, which they knew would make havock of the Church in the laſt dayes. But we on the contrary have reaſon to pray, That the end may be haſtned that ſo Antichriſt may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>If therefore we can finde that that ſpirit of devotion which we uſe in our Liturgy in the order of Prayers, Pſalms, Leſſons, Collects, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, Verſicles, Reſponds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be the ſame with that of the antient Churches before Rome uſurp'd Authority over the Churches, and that in their Eccleſiaſtick Miniſtrations there be <hi>(ſparſim)</hi> found ſome of the ſame expreſs terms which we uſe in ours, I hope we ſhall not be far from giving a clear teſtimony in this matter.</p>
                     <p>As for reading the holy Scriptures and ſinging of Pſalms, no man can deny that we therein do conform to the practice of all Churches ever ſince the beginning. And for our Collects this we ſhall ſay of them, When the order of <hi>Sarum</hi> (which probably was the ancienteſt wherein there was a compliancy with Romiſh Superſtitions) when I ſay that was firſt framed by that <hi>Oſmund</hi> aforeſaid, the Tradition that was then generally received concerning ſome forms of Prayer that were derived from Primitive Liturgies was the leſs regarded, and ſo might be ſwallowed up by time, becauſe they were in that <hi>Ordinale</hi>
                        <pb n="245" facs="tcp:42108:149"/>collected together, and brought thereby into Common and Publick uſe; whence it came to paſſe that the Collects of it, which we have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into our Liturgy, though according to the ſignificancy of the term, it is like they were collected from the Catholick Prayers of the Primitive Church, yet have no certain <hi>Conſtat</hi> for them that they were all of ſuch venerable Antiquity. Howſoever the matter of them being ſound and Catholick, and becauſe it is not to be imagined that one <hi>Oſmund</hi> though an Earl and a Biſhop ſhould be generally owned for <hi>Os mundi,</hi> the Speaker to the whole Church in the Liturgy of it, we may ſafely affirm that the ſaid Collects are of the ſame pure pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Original with the reſt of our Church-Service.</p>
                     <p>The form of Letany, in the next place, which is moſt cavill'd at, was ordered by Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi>

                     </p>

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42108:150"/>among them did highly commend it.</hi> Yea and Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> that Oracle of the Law of England, unto whom we have reaſon for his Gravity, Courage, and integrity in his place and calling (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the oblatrations of Popiſh <hi>Rabſhekah's</hi> againſt him) to give ſome heed more then ordinary,<note place="margin">Such was <hi>P.R.</hi> in his reckonings with Bp. <hi>Morton</hi> about Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.

                        </note> He I ſay affirmeth with much confidence That <hi>Pope Pius Quintus wrote unto Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>a letter about the tenth year of her Reign, offering to allow and ratifie the Engliſh Service-Book, if ſhe would accept it as from him, which ſhe refuſing to do, he did excommunicate her, and by his Bull roared out an Inhibition to all his party called Roman Catholicks, that they ſhould not from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth go to any of our Churches, while the ſaid Service-Book was read, though to the hearing of our Sermons a Toleration was granted unto them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude, Since the Primitive Pattern is thought fit next to the holy Scriptures to be a Standard for Church-Orders in the Service of God throughout the Chriſtian world, let our adverſaries and friends too, but conform unto it in ſuch a manner as we have done ſince we ſeparated from <hi>Rome,</hi> and I dare boldly ſay, we ſhall have no juſt cauſe in the ſight of God to charge one another with Superſtition.</p>
                     <p>And now that Imputation of Superſtition upon the account of our Liturgy, being, with as much brevity as the matter could well bear, yet ſufficiently, if not ſatisfactorily to our irrefragable opponents, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, We ſhould undertake the vindication likewiſe of Epiſcopal Government, for that alſo is by our Objectours brought under the ſame Cenſure. But concerning this neither need there much be ſaid, it being abundantly cleared of late againſt thoſe that have openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed themſelves enemies to that Government. We ſhall not here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Arguments that have been uſed in the behalf of Epiſcopacy, (ſuch an unſipid <hi>crambe</hi> muſt needs be nauſeous, unacceptable, and to no purpoſe) let all that are yet unſatisfied in that point read over and peruſe his late Majeſties Arguing about it with thoſe Miniſters that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Commiſſioners of Parl, at the Treaty in the Iſle of Wight,<note place="margin">

Once, thoſe very Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were ſo farre convinced thereby, that though they were very ſhy and unwilling to diſcover their mindes in a matter of ſo great and neceſſary conſequence, as to give his Majeſty ſatisfaction in thoſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42108:151"/>three <hi>Quaeries</hi> which he propounded unto them concerning Church-Government,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1</hi> Whether there be a certain Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment left by Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to be obſerved by all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es?</note> pretending that the whole volume of Eccleſiaſtical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was contained therein, yet they could not but acknowledge the remarkable Learning of his Reply, <hi>which was clothed,</hi> as they write, <hi>with a ſingular elegancy of ſtile, wiſhing that ſuch a Pen in the hand of ſuch Abilities might ever be employed in a Subject worthy of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet becauſe it will be expected that ſomewhat be here alſo ſaid in anſwer to this part of the before-mentioned objection, Let us take into conſideration the main Argument that is uſed againſt Epiſcopacy, and with a refutation of it put an end to this Controverſie.</p>
                     <p>That which is chiefly inſiſted upon by our Anti-epiſcopal men is the Identity of Denomination which they imagine the Scripture gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to Biſhops and Presbyters,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2</hi> Whether it bind perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, or be upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alterable in whole or in part?</note> from whence they will inferre the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity of Office, <hi>viz.</hi> That Biſhop and Presbyter are not diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in any part of their Authority, which the Lord hath given them for the edification of the Church. A principal inſtance hereof they alledge out of the Text of the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5.7. (upon which for brevities ſake we will onely fix, and which being cleared will help us to interpret aright other places of Scripture of the like nature) The words are theſe,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>3</hi> Whether that certain Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be the Epiſcopal, Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> 
                        <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in Crete that thou ſhouldſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City, as I had appointed thee. For a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs,</hi> &amp;c. In which place, ſay they, the Apoſtles reaſoning were altogether invalid and inconſequent, if Presbyter and Biſhop were not the ſame Office, as well as they have the ſame Name.</p>
                     <p>But how juſtly may it be here ſaid <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia?</hi> Theſe men that pretend to know more of the ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt in Scripture then others, and are apt to cenſure all that are not of the ſame judgment with them, are not ſo omniſcient, but that their brethren who come after them, may diſcern ſomewhat which they could not ſee. I ſhall therefore take the boldneſs to tell them my poor judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Scripture, hoping that I may make uſe of my liberty, as they do of theirs. I know well it is no new Opinion that I am about to encounter with; but becauſe our late Writers do with a higher confidence then ordinary ſeem to abound in their ſenſe concerning this matter, I ſhall endeavour their conviction.</p>
                     <p>And firſt I ſhall premiſe a Caution by the way, yielding in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie as much as may be conſiſtent with Truth. I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42108:151"/>to produce any poſitive Precept from the holy Ghoſt in this place for the eſtabliſhment of Epiſcopacy in the Church: it is enough to ſhew that a Divine Approbation is given of it, in deſcribing the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of the perſons that are to employed in ſuch an Office diſtinct from that of a Presbyter, together with their ſuperiority over Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and how they are to exerciſe their power in the ſeveral parts thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Ordination and Jurisdiction. Which Divine Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation if we can here finde, as I doubt not we ſhall, I hope it will be acknowledge by all to be Tant-amount to a Divine Inſtitution. And though it have not any poſitive Appointment in Scripture, but is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glanced at in ſome certain places; yet that ſhould not create any ſcruple in the mindes of any about it, no more then ſome points of Faith, which we freely profeſs, are ſcrupled by us, though we finde them not expreſly commanded in the written Word. Is it meet for any to ſay unto God, What doeſt thou? Who alas among us hath known the minde of the Lord? Or who hath been his Counſellour, to know fully the reaſon why he doth in ſuch a manner iſſue out his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts? Are not Clouds and thick Darkneſs ſet about the Pavilion of God? Let not ſilly man then dare to remove them. It would far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter become us to keep our diſtance, and to be wiſe according to ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then to arraign the pure word of Truth before the bar of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt reaſon; or to call the holy Spirit of God to account, for not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving full ſatisfaction (forſooth) to our fooliſh expectation. What if Chriſt, being willing to make his Regal Power the more known to the world, would onely give ſome ſmall intimation of his will concerning this matter (as he hath done of ſundry other things, which we need not here mention) to try the ſpirits of men, whether they would thereby be ſubject unto him or no? It is ordinary we know with the Princes of the earth to deal thus with their Subjects, by a look or a glance of the eye, or by a word of the mouth though uttered in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique way, to give notice of their further intentions, ſo to ſearch into and finde out the Loyalty and ready affections of thoſe about them: And ſhall Jeſus Chriſt be denyed this liberty?</p>
                     <p>This being premiſed, let us now come to inquire out the meaning of the Apoſtle in the afore-cited place, and ſee whether or no his words will allow of ſuch an Identity between Biſhop and Presbyter, as hath been commonly conceived; or rather, try whether by deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we can prove from thence the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, which
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42108:152"/>is ſo much contradicted in theſe days, onely let prejudice be forborn till ſuch time as we have put an end to this controverſie.</p>
                     <p>Firſt it cannot be denied that the Apoſtle writeth to <hi>Titus,</hi> as to one, with whom he had entruſted the ſole inſpection of that large and ſpacious Iſland (an Iſland containing in it an hundred Cities called therefore <hi>Hecatompolis</hi>) wherein his appointed work was, Not to gather a Church by converting the inhabitants thereof from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme and Judaiſme to the faith of the Goſpel; but the manner of governing a Church which was already gathered, was preſcribed unto him: And this is by the Apoſtle branched out into two things, <hi>viz Setting in order things that were amiſs or wanting,</hi> or as it is rendred by ſome (according to the original word here <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> correcting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and <hi>Ordaining Miniſters,</hi> both which plainly argue Epiſcopal authority; for no ſingle Presbyter was ever allowed even by our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epiſcopal men to manage ſuch a power: Now as according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.7. <hi>the leſs is bleſſed of the better,</hi> ſo muſt the correction of what is amiſs, and the power of conferring an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical office upon any be in a Superiour alſo.</p>
                     <p>I know well what is uſually objected here, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Titus</hi> was an Evangeliſt, that is, ſay ſome, an Aſſiſtant to the Apoſtle in his pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinations among the Churches, and therefore was endowed with an extraordinary power, inſomuch that his office was not capable of a Succeſſion. My anſwer hereto is this, It is granted that <hi>Titus</hi> for ſome time removed from place to place with the Apoſtle, as the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of his work required, one while at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> another while at <hi>Crete,</hi> from thence to <hi>Nicopolis</hi> he is ordered by the Apoſtle to come unto him; after that he is ſent to <hi>Corinth,</hi> from whence he is expected at <hi>Treas,</hi> and met with <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> whence he is ſent again to <hi>Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. as ſome have traced him in his ſeveral Stages: Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs though he was ſuch a temporary Itinerant with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and (if they will needs have it ſo) though he executed the office of an Evangeliſt in ſo doing, It followeth not that his firſt Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for <hi>Crete</hi> was thereby revoked, But that he did the office of an Evangeliſt while he attended the Apoſtle, may be granted, as he did while he was reſident in <hi>Crete,</hi> that is, by labouring in the Word and Doctrine. For after all that can be ſaid, other Evangeliſt <hi>Titus</hi> never was, nor can he ever be proved to be. Add hereunto, Neither can it be found that ever <hi>Titus</hi> had ſuch a peculiar charge given unto him in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42108:152"/>any of thoſe places, where he either accompanied the Apoſtle, or was employed by him, as he had in <hi>Crete:</hi> For was he ever appointed to ſuch a work either in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or in <hi>Corinth,</hi> or in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> or in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> or in any place elſe beſides <hi>Crete?</hi> Surely it cannot be imagined but that theſe places might need the care and vigilancy of a <hi>Titus</hi> as well as that to which he was conſign'd. If therefore ſuch an office of Government fixed upon one perſon, in one place, over a numerous Clergie, was for the advancement of the Goſpel, of ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in the dayes of the Apoſtles, who were not at all wanting in the diſcharge of their duty, without all contradiction it is at leaſt as neceſſary now, unleſs we will ſay that the care of the Churches well-fare was confin'd unto thoſe Primitive Times, and not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to after-ages.</p>
                     <p>All which conſidered, It is more then probable that the Apoſtle did devolve a power upon <hi>Titus,</hi> not of an Evangeliſt in the late upſtart ſenſe, but that which is indeed Epiſcopal, ſuperiour to that of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Presbyter, and not onely ſo, but that this was to be a preſident for the Government of the Churches to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>Eſpecially when we look upon the reaſon which the Apoſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexeth to the ſeventh verſe in theſe words, <hi>For a Biſhop muſt be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> &amp;c. Which for my part I conceive to be the ground of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles own act in leaving <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Crete</hi> for the ends and purpoſes there premiſed (knowing him to be a fit inſtrument for ſuch a weighty employment) and not at all to ſhew the qualification of the perſons whom he ſhould ordain, as it hath been commonly underſtood. Such qualification the Apoſtle had deſcribed in the ſixth verſe, ſaying, <hi>If any be blameleſs,</hi> that is, as a late Writer gloſſeth upon it, approved by the teſtimony of the Church to be under no ſcandalous ſin, <hi>The huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of one wife,</hi> that is, One who lives not with a ſecond wife after putting away the firſt, <hi>Having faithful children,</hi> that is, ſuch (if he have any) as have all received the Faith. (For if he bring not up his own children to be Chriſtian, what hope is there that he will be fit to convert others?) <hi>Not accuſed of riot or unruly,</hi> that is, who live tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and regularly: Meaning that <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould not ordain any, but thoſe that are thus qualified in reſpect of their own vertuous living, &amp; the Chriſtian education of their children: But now if he ſhould again in the ſeventh verſe repeat the ſame qualification of unblameableneſs, as referring to the ſame perſons, his words would border too much
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42108:153"/>upon an uncomely tautology, which was never incident to that ſpirit by which he wrote.</p>
                     <p>As I ſaid therefore before, ſo I ſay again, when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how the perſons ſhould be qualified, whom <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould ordain, he proceedeth to give <hi>Titus</hi> himſelf a reaſon, implying withal the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of his own Act, why he left him in <hi>Crete</hi> about ſuch an important buſineſs as to correct diſorders, and to ordain Elders. <hi>For</hi> ſaith he, <hi>A Biſhop</hi> (that is, one who muſt be employed in theſe things) <hi>muſt be</hi> (as I have found thee to be) <hi>blameleſs as the ſteward of God, not ſelf-willed,</hi> &amp;c. Otherwiſe with what face can he lay hands upon any, looking for ſuch qualifications as are juſt and fit for ſuch offices, if they be wanting in himſelf? Or how can he correct diſorders in others, if he himſelf be blame-worthy? Knowing therefore thee to be in all points fitted for this great work, I left thee in <hi>Crete,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>So that the intent of the Apoſtle here plainly is this, partly to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <hi>Titus</hi> concerning his leaving him there, as being for a purpoſe of an extrordinary concernment; but chiefly to ſhew the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the perſons to be employed in correcting and ordaining, upon whom he ſets an honourable mark of diſtinction for his works ſake, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him BISHOP, whereas the perſons or dained, he had before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by a title proper to their office, calling them <hi>Presbyters.</hi> This is one interpretation of the Apoſtles meaning, which I humbly ſubmit to the judgement of the Church. It is clear without any wreſt or ambiguity, and upon which it plainly follows that Biſhop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter are not one and the ſame, but diſtinct in their offices; and it is hereby as plain likewiſe that the office of Biſhop diſtinct from that of a Presbyter, is of divine inſlitution.</p>
                     <p>If this ſenſe will not be allowed by our Opponents, as for my part I know not why it ſhould be rejected, Let them conſider a ſecond.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>He left</hi> Titus <hi>in</hi> Crete <hi>to ordain Elders in every City,</hi> ſhewing in the ſixth verſe how they ſhould be qualified, <hi>viz. That they be blameleſs,</hi> &amp;c. And thereupon alledgeth his reaſon in the ſeventh verſe, <hi>For a</hi> BISHOP <hi>muſt be blameleſs</hi> &amp;c. He implieth the great care that <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould have in ordaining Elders, becauſe from among them BISHOPS were to be choſen for the Government of the Churches, whom it concern'd in regard of their power and authority above all others to be blameleſs, as the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42108:153"/>Stewards of God, not ſelf-willed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whence I collect that the office of BISHOP and Presbyter are not one and the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Some Objections poſſibly will be made againſt this interpretation alſo; but let judicious and ſober-minded men judge whether they be of ſuch weight, ſo as to carry the Apoſtles ſenſe againſt it.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs great is the confidence that hath been built upon this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Identity from whence hath ſprung much trouble to the Church of God: and none have exceeded therein ſo much above meaſure, as thoſe perſons, who with a ſtrange kinde of affectation called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by that Uncouth name of <hi>Smectymnuus;</hi> For they led on with this Errour, that BISHOP and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are one and the ſame, take upon them to tax the Apoſtles reaſoning as inconſequential, and his demand as they call it, Unjuſt, unleſs he ſubſcribe to their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Which cenſure they are likewiſe pleaſed to ſtretch out further by a ſimilitude according to their fancy: <hi>If a Chancellour,</hi> ſay they, <hi>in one of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities ſhould give order to his Vice-Chancellour to admit none to the degree of a Bachelour in arts, but ſuch as were able to preach, or keep a Divinity-Act, for Bachelours in Divinity muſt be ſo, what reaſon or equity were in this? So if</hi> Paul <hi>leaving</hi> Titus <hi>in</hi> Crete <hi>ſhould give order to him, not to admit any to be an Elder, but one thus and thus qualified, becauſe a Biſhop muſt be ſo, Had a Biſhop been an Order or Calling diſtinct from or ſuperiour to a Presbyter, and not the ſame, this had been no more rational or equal then the former.</hi> Thus They. But the ſenſe of the Apoſtle being rendred as before (which for ought that I can ſee may very well be ſo) Their ſimilitude, or ſomewhat alike unto it, may be retorted upon them in this manner, If a Chancellour in one of our Univerſities ſhould give order to his Vice-Chancellour to admit none to the degree of a Bachelour in Divinity, but ſuch as were learned in the Scriptures, of good report, and of a grave and ſober converſation, for Doctours in Divinity (who are to be taken out of that lower degree) muſt be ſo, there would be both reaſon and equity in ſuch a Command; ſo when the Apoſtle gives order to <hi>Titus</hi> not to admit any to be a Presbyter, but one that is blameleſs, becauſe a BISHOP who is to be choſen out of the Presbytery muſt be ſo, I hope the Divine ſpirit of this <hi>Doctor gentium</hi> may paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out control, and not have an imputation of irrationality any more put upon him, though it be affirmed (as the truth is) that the office
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42108:154"/>of a BISHOP is here diſtinguiſhed by him from that of a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and made Superiour unto it.</p>
                     <p>Let none now think of me that becauſe of this my free manner of writing, I have deſign'd thereby to make way for a <hi>Polemical</hi> diſpute with ſome perſons of note that are contrary minded in this caſe, they would miſtake me much that ſhould judge ſo of me: I am not willing to be reckoned among the diſputers of this world, And I do confeſs my ſelf the unfitteſt of many upon ſundry accounts for ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking: beſides there hath been too much wrangling already among us, Animoſities have encreaſed to the great decay of brotherly-Love in the management of this controverſy, occaſioned chiefly by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Identity.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.20.</note> But <hi>the wrath of man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>worketh not the Righteouſneſs of God:</hi> And what have all the <hi>Jehu</hi>-like ſallies, and furious heats of the adverſaries of Epiſcopacy at length produced, What I ſay whereby Gods name may be honoured, or his Church e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified? Is not the ſhame of their nakedneſs made bare to the view of all men? Oh that God would now give repentance unto all thoſe that are conſcious to themſelves of a guilt herein.</p>
                     <p>Even thoſe very perſons that I mentioned before, who were the Ring leaders in this difference, have reaſon ſadly to lay it to heart, if they be yet living, who had they but followed that Counſel themſelves which they gave unto that Reverend BISHOP with whom they did contend, their offenſe had not been ſo great, <hi>viz. To have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten more cautiouſly, and to have given leſs ſcope to their luxuriant pen;</hi> for as they did let it run into cauſeleſs aggravations, it did certainly bring too great a ſcandal upon Religion, and made good their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries charge againſt them. But ſince things that are paſt cannot be wholly recalled, Oh that they would give glory to God in confeſſing their Errour, and endeavour to repair again thoſe breaches which their inadvertency hath made, by a publick retractation. They are men that pretend much to tenderneſs of Conſcience, and therefore I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume are not of that proud Cardinal's ſpirit, who confeſſed there was need enough to reform the abuſes of the <hi>Romiſh</hi>-Church, but he could not endure that <hi>Luther</hi> a poor beggarly Friar (as he call'd him) ſhould give the firſt Onſet unto it: I hope better things of theſe men, as to this caſe, in their capacity, and that they will not diſdain for this once to receive a word of Exhortation from one that is leaſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42108:154"/>eſteemed in the Church; becauſe they know well, that the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable the perſon is, as to his outward eſtate, that gives them an advice of ſuch concernment as this, they may the more magnifie God's name in a ready conſenting thereunto.</p>
                     <p>But to return to our purpoſe, I have here offered my conceptions in the expounding of this Scripture, which hath been ſo much controverted of late, humbly preſenting them to the judgment of the Church, not knowing that ever yet any expoſitour Antient or Modern hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the ſenſe of it ſo before. If the glory of God may hereby be advanced, and the Churches peace promoted, I have my aime, and it ſhall be the Crown of my rejoycing to my dying day. But as to the Objection that hath thus let out my thoughts ſo far towards this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I will be confident that either of theſe interpretations that are here given, will ſooner be received by thoſe that are wiſe and moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, then our adverſaries wreſt which hath hitherto created ſo much trouble unto us.</p>
                     <p>The reſult will be this. Epiſcopal Government is warranted by the word of God, therefore it is no ſuperſtition to have it reeſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Church, nor no tranſgreſſion of the Law of Chriſt, to yield ſubjection unto it.</p>
                     <p>And now to finiſh this matter: whereas there hath been a Cry made, Away with Superſtition and Away with Idolatry, Away made, Away with Superſtition and Away with Idolatry, Away with Liturgy and Away with Biſhops, we may clearly ſee by what is here written, that this clamour is altogether cauſeleſs. Poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are thus woſully deluded, the Lord pitie them, and the Lord forgive them, for they know not what they ſay. Much more reaſon ſurely is there to cry out with a ſhout, Bleſſed be God for Liturgy and Epiſcopacy, whereby we are now really and in truth delivered out of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Admit that our Liturgy be found in the manner of ſome expreſſions and tranſlation of it, fit to be changed, for the reaſons of expediency and condeſcenſion, (wherein nevertheleſs we are for the churches ſake to ſubmit to the wiſdom of thoſe in whoſe power it is, to order that change) yet as it is, conſidering the woful effects which the want of it hath produced, and in regard of the reaſons before ſpecified, it will well become all that fear God heartily to rejoyce at its Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Admit alſo (which yet without contradicting the Holy Ghoſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42108:155"/>be granted) that Epiſcopacy were as bad in its own nature, as Schiſmaticks would make it: yet it muſt be acknowledged to be far better then that Anarchy in the Church, which was projected by the late Sect of Over-turners for their own ſiniſter ends: But it is now manifeſt that this deſpiſed, perſecuted Epiſcopacy, is not an humane Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical ordinance but Divine, and therefore it is that Government under which we may have the greateſt confidence that Religion may flouriſh, and our ſouls may proſper. Eſpecially when we look upon thoſe grave and reverend perſons, who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to that office and charge, and finde them, according to his gracious MAJESTIES Declaration,<note place="margin">Concerning Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs.</note> men of learning, virtue and piety, ſuch of whom the world is not worthy, if it ſhould ſtill perſiſt in enmity againſt them. I name none, for by their works and by their ſufferings you may know them. Onely let that free and faithful Speech uttered in a Sermon before his Majeſty that now is (whom God long preſerve) at the time of his Coronation, ſhew what manner of ſpirit a Biſhop may be of when he is employed in his Maſters buſineſs in preaching the Goſpel,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Apr.</hi> 23.1661.</note> which was this, <hi>Thoſe perſons</hi> (meaning Kings and Princes) <hi>that can be puniſhed by none but God, ſhall be ſure to be moſt ſeverely puniſhed by God, if becauſe they can be puniſhed by none but him, they preſume the more to ſin againſt him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What a thunder clap is this to be rattled in the ears of a King when he is in the height of his temporal glory? Let any now, or all of that ſort of people, who are apt to cry out Away with Biſhops. but try a little their own ſpirits, and ſee whether at any time they have been, or can be more faithful in ſpeaking of Gods teſtimonies in ſuch an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and not be diſmayed. I ſay therefore again, Let not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Nation any more be ſuch enemies to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and their own ſouls, as to ſay Away with Liturgy and Away with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy; rather we ſhould ſay</p>
                     <p>Away with Schiſme and that virulency of ſpirit which hath too much prevailed upon us in theſe later times, againſt thoſe things that are ſo conſonant to the holy Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Away with pride, which we have experimentally found to be the Mother of contention, and the fore-runner of confuſion, whoſe ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of late with ſcorn and contempt have ſuperabounded, Her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren pretending to tread down the pride of others,<note place="margin">

                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:42108:155"/>
                     <p>Away with hypocriſy and diſſembling holineſs which hath ever been accounted a double iniquity. It is the beſt ſervant the Devil hath, and ſhall have anſwerable wages above all the reſt.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.51</note> This is that Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile that could weepe and houle, when it had a deſign to deſtroy and ſwallow us up quick, That <hi>Jezebel</hi> that could proclaim a faſt when ſhe projected cruelty and oppreſſion, That Phariſee that could make long prayers, when poor Widows and Orphans houſes were at the end of his devotion, That Judas that would kiſs and betray in the ſame breath, cry All hail, and in the very inſtant ſmite under the fift rib, therefore Away with it.</p>
                     <p>Away with ſelf-ſeeking that hath cramb'd the bags and fill'd the coffers of covetous earth-worms with the ruines of their Country.</p>
                     <p>Away with Hereſie and Blaſphemy, The one cuts the throat of truth, which ſhould be dearer unto us then our lives, And the other flies in the face of God Almighty, and bids defiance againſt Heaven, Both which I dare ſay have a deeper place in Hell then Superſtition, yet both of them rode circuit about this Nation, while it ſtood un-Churched by our diviſions, and unkinged by our ſins.</p>
                     <p>Away with that Image of Jealouſie, that Anti-Catholick and Anti-Chriſtian Toleration, which for politick ends and purpoſes hath cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly yet moſt profanely been cryed up as the common intereſt of <hi>Sion</hi> that God takes care of, as if an abomination of deſolation were now become the Churches glory, And the way to preſerve truth in its purity were to blend it with Errour. Had this curſed project con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as it began, well might that Machiavellian principle in time have paſſed for ſound doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That all ſhall be ſaved in their own Religion, though the Church of this Kingdom would (as it was once ſaid) ſooner have become the Devils dancing-ſchole then Gods Temple. In the mean time thoſe poor Superſtitious Malignants that durſt ſhew themſelves in the behalf of Liturgy and Epiſcopacy muſt be ſure above others to be exempted from this indulgence, and ſo left to periſh without any remedy: doubtleſs this juggling did rouſe up the jealouſie of the Almighty, and therefore it was high time to ſend it packing.</p>
                     <p>Away with Irreverence, Profaneſs, Looſeneſs, Sordidneſs in the Service of the Holy and Dreadful God, which in the judgement of all that are truely pious is far worſe then that other extreme of overmuch Curioſity and Superſtition, This in ſome kinde preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

If indeed to encourage themſelves in an evil matter, ſo as not to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in the proſecution of it by the approaches of death, and their appearance before the great God, hath made them fit to be exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to thoſe that undertake to be their Advocates, let them be cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42108:156"/>for Saints, whom the World not onely Chriſtian but Heathen hath hitherto abhorred as bloud-thirſty and deceitful men: But ſo long as the Word and Statute law of the moſt high God is in force, and remains unretracted, it is not their conſtancy in their treaſon to the death, nor their ſmooth language, how ſpiritual ſoever it ſeemed to be, wherewith they left the World, that ſhall come up in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance before God at the laſt day to their comfort, if they died in the juſtification of that guilt, for which they were condemned. No un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing, ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, muſt enter into Heaven, And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all pollutions, that of bloud upon the conſcience is in the ſight of God moſt filthy.</p>
                     <p>True it is, they neglected the body (to uſe the Apoſtles word) but what advantage will that be to them, if they likewiſe neglected the ſoul? Hiſtory will tell us, it is no newes to hear of a reſolved obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and obſirmation of mind in the ſuffering of death.

                     <p>We ſhould not I confeſs have thus ſtept aſide to make this rehearſal of the flagitious wickedneſs of ſuch unworthy perſons, whoſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will be odious to all Generations, had it not been neceſſary to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive others who are prone to applaud and juſtifie them becauſe of their ſeeming fortitude at the time of their death.

                     <p>I called it a Seeming Fortitude which theſe Traitors ſhewed at their

What conſtancy or Chriſtian fortitude could be in them, when after they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Law did take hold upon them to bring them to their condign puniſhment, they would then all on a ſudden pretend to an undantedneſs of ſpirit in their juſtification, whereas ſome few dayes before, while they were upon their Trial, the greateſt number of them did ſue for mercy, pretending a claim to his Majeſties pardon, which muſt needs carry with it an Implicite acknowledgment of guilt.</p>
                     <p>With what face could <hi>Axtell</hi> at his death make his boaſt of the Cauſe, profeſſing that if he had a thouſand lives he could lay them all down for it, when at his tryal (as he ſaid) <hi>he had endeavoured to obtain the mercy and favour of his Majeſty?</hi> And that when ſome witneſſed againſt him, that he did beat the ſouldiers, becauſe they did not at his bidding, cry out againſt the King for juſtice and execution, he ſhifted it off thus, ſaying, That it was more probable, becauſe they did cry out for juſtice and execution, he did therefore ſtrike them, uſing theſe words, <hi>I'll Juſtice you, I'll Execution ye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what conſtancy did appear in <hi>Cook,</hi> the moſt zealous of them all, when the words he uttered at his death contradicted his pleadings at his tryal for his life, as the book ſet forth with too partial a reſpect unto him doth relate? At his death he expreſt himſelf in this manner, <hi>I am ſatisfied that the Cauſe</hi> (that is, that which was maintained againſt the King) <hi>is the moſt noble and glorious Cauſe that hath been agitated for God and Chriſt ſince the Apoſtolical times, Such a Cauſe that the Martyrs would gladly come again to ſuffer for, if they might. And though too many object againſt me that of the Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Pet. 4 15. <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as a murtherer, yet I look upon it as a moſt noble and high act of Juſtice that our Story can parallel, And ſo far as I had a hand in it, never any one action in all my life comes to my minde with leſs regret or trouble of conſcience then that doth.</hi> Now compare this with what was ſworn againſt him at his tryal, and thoſe excuſes and evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he then uſed to ſhift off his Charge: One of the witneſſes that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42108:157"/>appeared having been of his intimate acquaintance affirmed upon oath,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</note> That when he underſtood that the ſaid <hi>Cock</hi> was employed as a Solicitour againſt the King, he deſired him with tears to conſider the dangerous conſequences of ſuch a proceeding, and to deſiſt from it, whereunto his anſwer was this, <hi>I acknowledge it is a very baſe buſineſs, but they put it upon me, and I cannot avoid it.</hi> This being witneſſed againſt him at his trial, he had not ſo much confidence then as to deny it. Whereby it ſeems that one while he accounted it a very baſe buſineſs, another while after he had gotten preferment by it, it was the moſt Noble and Glorious Act that ever he did in all his life. His Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo charging him with Malice, He replyed, that <hi>he acted onely as a Counſellour for his fee, ſo that it might be</hi> (as he ſaid) <hi>called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varitia</hi> not <hi>malitia, Covetouſneſs, not Malice.</hi> And being told that he demanded judgement againſt the King, He anſwered, <hi>His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, judgement for his acquittal.</hi> Yea further, when he was in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he did, as he ſaid, put in a Petition to the Honourable Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners that he might have the benefit of his Majeſties Declaration at <hi>Breda:</hi> but when he ſaw his expectation therein to be fruſtrated by the ſentence of death upon him, the Caſe is altered, his Death muſt be a Martyrdom, and the Cauſe for which he ſuffers, the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cauſe that ever was agitated for God and Chriſt ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical times. Juſt like ſome ſturdy Beggar, who at firſt will ſeem to be very humble, pouring out his prayers for ſuch as will relieve him, but if he have not an almes given him according to his asking, he preſently falls to curſing and banning. Let now the beſt friends this man had, judge whether he be to be commended for conſtancy and fortitude in his Cauſe, or to be condemned for ſhameful ſhuffling and halting in it, and conſequently whether he be a fit pattern for their imitation.</p>
                     <p>Had he and the reſt of his fellows in iniquity but given teſtimony of ſo much ſelf-denial, as to have refuſed that Wealth and Preferment which they gained by their buſy actings in their Cauſe, and have kept themſelves in that inferiour rank, wherein they were before they had brought ſo much miſchief upon us, they might poſſibly not have been ſo ſubject to cenſure as they were: but when they coveted feilds and houſes, and took them by violence, oppreſſed a man and his houſe, even a man and his heritage, when they ſpoiled for themſelves (as the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> ſpeaketh) and like wretched <hi>Ahab</hi> did kill, and alſo take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

                     <p>Now therefore O fooliſh people and unwiſe that are ſo miſerably deluded with vain and empty ſhadows of holineſs and conſtancy in a pretended cauſe of Religion, be warned betimes, and as you love your ſouls, never let them enter into the ſecret of theſe men, nor be baptiſed with the baptiſme that they were baptiſed with. Away I ſay with that ſpirit of Rebellion and Sedition, of Diviſion and Deluſion that hath too long haunted this Nation, Let it from henceforth never be entertained by us any more: And if we have not quite loſt that antient genuine integrity and goodneſs of Nature that hath been pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the natives of this Kingdom, we will all joyn hearts and hands together to ſend it packing.</p>
                     <p>Conſider what hath been ſaid, and the Lord give us a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in all things. But I hope it is now made evident who they be among us that come neereſt to the pattern here preſented unto us in the text, in being ſtill the ſame, Whether thoſe that have framed the objection which hath cauſed this diſpute, or thoſe againſt whom the objection is framed.</p>
                     <p>And now becauſe this Text is in an eſpecial manner intended for the inſtruction &amp; encouragement of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to ſubmit themſelves to the Scepter of Chriſt's government, I ſhall out of a friendly zeal for their Converſion make another ſhort Application unto them.</p>
                     <p>O yee that were once a people, and who ſhall again (we believe) be glorious among the Nations, be at length informed aright concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſiah, whom I hope you will upon a peruſal of what is here written (if you ſuffer not prejudice to captivate your judgment) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be this Jeſus onely, whom your Fathers perſecuted and we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore.

                     <p>And now to conclude, What is it (O ye miſerably blinded people) that you ſtick at? If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Son of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, our Lord and our God, hath not exactly fulfilled all that was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of the Meſſiah, If he hath not done the works that no other man did, or can do, If you have not hitherto ſmarted enough under that heavy Curſe, which your fathers brought upon you, when they crucified the Lord Jeſus, crying out, His bloud be upon us and our children, go on then ſtill in your pertinacy, deny him to be the Lord that bought you, look for another that can do more for you, then he hath done: For us, in the mean time, we will bewail before the Lord your woful blindeneſs and hardneſs of heart; and though we cannot converſe with you as brethren, becauſe of your perverſneſs in your preſent infidelity, yet we will pity you, as thoſe who were once a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in whom the Lord delighted, yea as thoſe of whom we have good hope upon the return of your Captivity, to ſee you made the glory of Nations, a Praiſe in the earth: Which hope as we may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it will not fail us, in the time and ſeaſon which the Father hath

                     <p>Laſtly, Since it is ſo that Jeſus Chriſt is the Same to day which he was yeſterday, then have the Churches of the Gentiles good reaſon to rejoyce in that they, ſubmitting themſelves to Chriſts yoke, may be ſure that the ſame Divine Love which was of old manifeſted to the Jews is in as full meaſure according to their capacity extended towards them. What high account was made of Iſrael heretofore, the holy Scripture doth every where tell us; How God entred into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, was nigh unto them in all that they call'd upon him for, eſteemed them his Inheritance, his Vineyard, his peculiar Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when all other Nations were rejected as unclean,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11.</note> proclaimed Out-laws, and caſt forth as dogs, not ſuffered to intermeddle with the childrens Priviledge: But now ſince the Holy Ghoſt hath not onely told us, that Jeſus Chriſt the meſſenger of this Covenant, the parcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of this Inheritance, the planter of this Vineyard, the great Lord-Keeper of this Treaſury hath broken down the wall of Partition that was between Jews and Gentiles,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14.</note> making both one, but that he is alſo the Same to day which he was yeſterday, as able now to ſave them to the uttermoſt whoſoever they be that come unto God by him, and as ready to do the will of the Father, in being a Light to lighten the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles (according to the Prophecies of old) as to be the glory of his people Iſrael, we may therefore be confident in our approaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, looking for mercy and grace to help in time of need, being as much intereſſed in all the happy Priviledges of the everlaſting Covenant of Promiſe, as ever were the Jews; there is no difference now, ſaith the Apoſtle, between the Jew and the Greek, for the ſame Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him, For whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved: Now is the true heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſound gone into all lands, the Goſpel preached to every creature, which the Apoſtles carried about when they had their Commiſſion given them to go into all the world, their Line reached to the ends of the earth,<note place="margin">

                     <p>It is not my purpoſe here to diſpute this point at large, being out of my way; enough hath been written of it already. And it hath been found by experience to be a toylſome task to run the wilde-gooſe chaſe (as a learned divine now with God once phraſed it) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a well breathed Opinioniſt, they delight in Vitilitigation,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Nath.

I ſhall not therefore ſay much to this quarelſome people: Let them conſider how they will anſwer the Apoſtle here who avoucheth <hi>Jeſus Chriſt to be thee Same to day which he was yeſterday.</hi> Certainly if the infants of the Jews were by virtue of Chriſts mediatory office to be received into the boſome of the Church, and diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that were without by a Solemn Sacrament of initiation, but the infants of Chriſtian parents, to whom belongeth the Kingdom of God, as as well as to the Jews before, muſt not be allowed to partake of a like priviledge, but be reckoned ſtill as dogs (as the Scripture calls all that are without) Jeſus Chriſt is not the Same according to the Apoſtles word, Neither is his office now of ſo much uſe unto his Church, as it hath been formerly; Of ſuch blaſphemy as this, not to be mentioned without horrour, muſt this curſed errour be the foundation.</p>
                     <p>But let me ask of theſe deceivers, How came it to paſs that Chriſt hath not obtained this priviledge for our Infants, as well as he did for the Jews, ſeeing God is not now the God of the Jews onely, but of the Gentiles alſo? Surely it muſt be either becauſe he would not, or becauſe he could not; To ſay he would not, doth plainly demonſtrate his love of us to be leſs, then it was of the Jews, which agreeth not with that abundant grace that hath been now revealed in the time of the Goſpel; To ſay he could not, contradicteth that univerſal power w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the father had given unto him in heaven and in Earth; The exerciſe of which power he would firſt have to be manifeſted in diſcipling whole Nations of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">

Where the word (Nation) in order to the Gentiles muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controverſie be taken in the ſame ſenſe, as it was with a reference unto the Jews; for as the Nation of the Jews was made up of all ſorts and ſexes, old and young, ſo in like manner are the Nations of the Gentiles: And becauſe his commiſſion, which he then gave unto his Apoſtles, was not formed according to the erroneous fancy of theſe
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42108:163"/>deluded people, who in effect render it thus, <hi>Go and Diſciple all men,</hi> But thus, <hi>Go and Diſciple all Nations, baptiſing them in the name,</hi> &amp;c. And Children being a part of the Nations, we may conclude with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any heſitancy that the intent and purpoſe of the Lord in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Apoſtles was, that they ſhould whereſoever they came, baptiſe the Children as well as the Parents. And ſeeing he came to break down the wall of partition that was between Jews and Gentiles, which was actually done in the execution of this Commiſſion, It is not to be imagined that he would by it ſet up a partition-wall between Parents and their Children, ſo as that they ſhould be at as great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the one from the other in point of eternal Salvation, as Heaven is from Hell; A thing he never did in all the Ages before, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly whatſoever theſe Dreamers may blaſphemouſly prate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, He hath not done it now becauſe he is ſtill the Same.</p>
                     <p>I will not dwell any longer upon the Conviction of theſe obſtinate people, leaſt the more reaſon be ſhewed unto them out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to lead them into the way of truth, they be thereby, according to their uſual wont, the more hardened in their errour: The Lord open their eyes that they may ſee betimes, what diſhonour they bring unto Jeſus Chriſt in the diminution of his power by their frantick Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.

                  <p>WE ſhould now according to our preſcribed method come to ſpeak of the third courſe or computation of time here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Text, and of that which is predicated of it, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>But to avoid Prolixity which hath already ſpun out the former parts into a greater length then was intended, we ſhall not diſtinguiſh this into ſeveral propoſitions, as hath been done with thoſe before: Neither indeed can we be able to ſpeak of what ſhall come upon the Church in the continuation of this day of the Goſpel to the end of the world: Onely this we can ſay, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth it, That perſecutions and Afflictions do abide it, but withall that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt will be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> unto it, which he ever hath been. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon therefore ſhall we fix the ſhort remainder of our diſcourſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving ſome inferences from it for the further edification of thoſe that take pleaſure in beholding the immutability of the Lord Jeſus. Obſerve then.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the midſt of all the various changes and chances that may come upon the Church to the end of the world Jeſus Chriſt will be unto it ſtill, The Same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning ſhall ever be found in him, either in his Mediation with the Father, or in the diſpenſation of his power among his people, But he will be <hi>Semper idem,</hi> Alwayes the Same.</p>

                  <p>Now herein we can but ſpeak of the exerciſe of Chriſts Mediatory office, as we have already done, and therefore it will be needleſs to ſpend many words about it.

He may ſpeak of the glory of his Kingdom, and talk of his power, to make known to the Sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious Majeſty of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; But to imitate him in his power and his mighty Acts, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with him in the Majeſty of his Kingdom, would not onely be a contempt caſt upon his Crown and Dignity, but an utter impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and a meere vanity for men or angels to attempt it: They poor Creatures being infinitely unfit and unworthy, muſt let that alone for
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42108:164"/>ever, and they that will expect it of them will finde it to be folly and ſhame unto them.</p>
                  <p>I might here enter into a large diſcourſe upon this point, and open a great door and effectual for the conviction of ſundry enemies of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who by their Opinions and practices do in effect deny him to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And firſt we may here be aſcertained concerning the perpetuity of the Church to the end of the World. For becauſe Chriſt will be the Same for ever, the Church muſt continue to be for ever alſo. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Man and the Woman, <hi>Neither is the Man without the Woman, nor the Woman without the Man in the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.11.</note> So may we ſay of Chriſt and his Church, neither can the Church be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, nor Chriſt (as Mediatour) be without the Church;<note place="margin">Relato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum uno poſito po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum, nec eſt relatio niſi inter ea quae ſunt actu. <hi>Objection.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But do we not ſee the Church in a conſumptive eſtate, groaning and panting under a moſt heavy croſs, melting her ſelf into tears, yea ready even to give up the Ghoſt?</p>
                  <p>We may be deceived, when we think it is at a low ebb, it may be at that very inſtant in a moſt flouriſhing Condition. What it loſeth in outward proſperity, it may gain in ſpiritual growth. We muſt not bound our conceits of the Church and Kingdom of Chriſt, according to the models of the Kingdoms of this World. For though this <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>china munai,</hi> this great engine, frame and ſtructure, may decreaſe and diminiſh in its ſtrength and beauty (as the opinion of ſome is) by reaſon, of the claſhings and ſhakings that happen among the parts thereof, till that which is now <gap reason="foreign">

And as poiſon when it is corrected by the skill
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42108:165"/>of the Phyſician works more effectually for the health of a ſick patient then a wholeſome herb, ſo certainly ſhall the Church grow better by her troubles, then if ſhe had been all this while ſettled in a moſt peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Though the Church be afflicted, and the enemies thereof may ſeem to proſper,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auſ.</hi> 2.</note> yet let us nor conclude raſhly thereupon that Chriſt hath forſaken her, and that ſhe ſhall unavoidably periſh. Let <hi>David</hi> lead you a little into the Sanctuary,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, As we have aſſurance given us here of the perpetuity of the Catholick Church, notwithſtanding all her diviſions within her, and her perſecutions from without; ſo we may finde a remedy cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the rich Cabinet of this Text, which will be ſufficient (if well applied) to cure the diſtempers of our particular Churches. Thoſe diſtempers I ſay which have been and ſtill are occaſioned by our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling about ſetting up Jeſus Chriſt in his Throne, and the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Kingdom amongſt us, according to his own rule and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For the healing whereof, and to perſwade to a Brotherly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure therein, What can be more prevalent then this, <hi>viz. Jeſus Chriſt is the Same for ever?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We all pretend to look unto JESUS, and it is indeed our duty to eye him in all the diſpenſations of his power and providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Church, that we may not vary from that courſe and order, wherein he hath always trained up his people, nor be led aſide by new-fangled devices, either of our own or others. But let us conſider, If he be <hi>Semper idem,</hi> alwayes the Same, How is it that we are thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided about him? What? Shall the rule and Canon of our Union be conſtant and perpetual, and ſhall we be ſtill to ſeek for a way of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? Let diſſenting Brethren but lay aſide Animoſities and prejudices wherewith they have ſo eaſily been beſet, and follow the track and foot-ſleps of the Lord Jeſus, and we ſhall quickly ſee an end of all our differences.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20 18.</note> 
                     <hi>They were wont to ſay in old time</hi> (ſaid that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Iſrael) <hi>They ſhall ſurely ask counſel at Abel, and ſo they end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42108:165"/>the matter;</hi> Now alſo according to the word of the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture, <hi>Let us ſtand in the wayes, and ſee and ask for the old pathes, where is the good way?</hi> The way wherein the Lord himſelf hath walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>and let us walk therein, and we ſhall finde reſt for our ſouls;</hi> Wee ſhall ſee Salvation is neer unto us, yea neerer then we are aware, and that Glory doth dwell in our Land.</p>
                  <p>The voice of the Oracle which would guide us into the good way; ſpeakes in this manner, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Same yeſterday, to day and for ever;</hi> Which in effect tells us, our foundation is ſure and ſtedfaſt, and our corner-ſtone, as it hath hitherto brought on the building into an excellent frame on the one ſide, in the Ages that are paſt, ſo it would alſo do the like on the other, in theſe our dayes, and the Ages that are to come, if there were but ſuch a conformity held with it, as there hath been in former times. True it is the Word written is an infallible rule for the guiding of us in matters of Faith, from which we are not to digreſs, It is ſo likewiſe in all things elſe that concern the Worſhip of God, and the publick good of the Church, ſo far as it doth lead and direct us therein; but unleſs we will ſay that Chriſt hath deſerted his Church ever ſince he gave a being unto it, we muſt avow his continued courſe and practice in the ordering of it (which I hope none will ſay is contrary to what he hath written) to be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant alſo of our Subjection thereto. What then is that good way? Not ſurely the way of Diviſion and Separation, which tendeth to Confuſion; for God is not the Authour thereof, neither will he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of it in any of the Churches of the Saints: but of Unity and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that all ſuch as make profeſſion of the Goſpel may be of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and as they ſtand in their ſeveral relations to the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wiſdom of God and his good Providence hath placed them, to bear up, as with one ſhoulder, the glory of Chriſt's Name againſt ſin, the World, and the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Look now unto JESUS. Firſt, It hath been his conſtant deſign to bring all thoſe who believe in him into a Brotherly fellowſhip one with another, not onely to unite them in ſeveral Societies, as ſome would have it, but to gather thoſe Societies into one Body; And the more there is of this Union among thern under Himſelf, who is the ſole head of the Body (which Dignity none can challenge (if it be but by way of Reſemblance) without Anti-Chriſtian Uſurpation, and a preſumptuous encroachment upon him) it hath ever been moſt
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42108:166"/>agreeable to his mind and will. This I ſay hath been the product of his eternal wiſdom for the eſtabliſhment of his Kingdom in the midſt of the Nations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It hath always been his work to ſettle a Government in his Church for the well being of it, that peace and love might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved amongſt his people, puniſhments inflicted upon the unpeacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unruly, and that all things, eſpecially in the duties of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip and ſervice might be done (according to the variety of emergencies ariſing in ſeveral Nations and Ages) <hi>Decently and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> (For that is decent and orderly in one place and time, which by experience proveth to be uncomely and diſorderly in another) Which government being <hi>de facto</hi> to ſay nothing of it here <hi>de jure</hi> (enough hath been ſaid of that before) continued from the beginning, he hath been pleaſed to bleſs and proſper with a moſt happy ſucceſs, to the enlargement of his Kingdom, and the propagation of his Goſpel: Which we may well preſume he would not have done in ſo long a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of time, and ſo many viciſſitudes of troubles and deliverances that have come upon his Church, if it had not been according to his minde; but ſince it is ſo, and the Apoſtle here telling us, that he is the Same for ever, we may probably conclude that as he hath not left his Church without a care of her well-being in this particular, ſo he will not digreſs from it, but that ſuch a Government ſo continued and made ſucceſsful by him ſhall be perpetuated, as own'd by him, to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>Let us then I ſay again look unto Jeſus, and ſee his goings in his Sanctuary in the midſt of his people from the beginning, Let us ſee alſo and acknowledge his Immutability therein; for the Eternity of Iſrael is not as man that he ſhould lye, or the ſon of man that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: As in all other things that he hath undertaken for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his kingdome, ſo undoubtedly in this he will be the Same for ever. If therefore this hath been his work and deſign, to eſtabliſh u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and order in his Church, and to ſettle and proſper this very go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in it, which is this day ſo much contradicted, will it become thoſe that pretend to have an intereſt in him to walk contrary to him? Or will he ceaſe to be the Same in the carrying on of his own work, in his good old way, to pleaſe thoſe unquiet people that will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſatisfied, but make the world believe they do him the greateſt ſervice, when they do what they can to hinder his work?</p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:42108:166"/>
                  <p>What though ſome mens Tongues and pens run riot, crying out ſtill for liberty, Liberty of Conſcience (not conſidering that to ſerve the Lord in a chearful ſubmiſſion to his ſweet yoke, wherewith he hath always kept his Church in good order, is perfect freedom; nor being willing to know nor underſtand that <hi>Conſcientia in tantum libera in quantum ab errore liberata, Conſcience is ſo far free, as it is freed from errour</hi>) Yet we may be ſure Jeſus Chriſt will ſtill keep on his courſe, becauſe he is the Same for ever. And let Conſcience it ſelf (for which all this clamour is made) whereſoever it is not enthralled to luſt or errour, judge in this caſe, Whether it be a liberty which Chriſt hath purchaſed for thoſe that believe in him, to croſs him in his work, which he hath hitherto wrought for the good of his Church. I ſpeak not here of what he hath permitted a long time for the trial of his people, and the advancement of his truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as being able to bring good out of evil) but what he hath alwayes acted, as the King of his Church, and which the very nature of his office did indeed require ſhould be done; For any to quarrel at his actings, and to call in queſtion all that he hath hitherto done in that kinde, as if he had been ever ſince his aſcenſion onely a ſpectatour of his Church, to ſee how well ſhe could ſhift for her ſelf in her own preſervation, without the exerciſe of his power by ſettling a government in her, what is this but to tax him with negligence in his office, and to make him a Saviour but in part, which in effect is to be none at all?</p>
                  <p>What though there be ſome things that are circumſtantial to this Government, and ſome Ceremonies in divine worſhip that have not an immediate ſtamp of Divine authority upon them to make them currant (which will never be found in the whole inſtitute and order of any Church) ſhould we therefore reject all that is in them good and warrantable? Becauſe people have not their deſire in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſhould they not conſent to that which is neceſſary for the honour of Chriſt, and the welfare of his Church? Two things that ſhould be dearer to us then our lives, much more are they to be preferred before a ſelf-ſatisfaction in ſome ſcrupulous niceties, the bare uſing,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8.</note> or not uſing whereof (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of meat) commendeth us not to God. But alas theſe things are not regarded as they ought to be Mens novel apprehenſions of the Kingdome of Chriſt, and their particular intereſts therein muſt counter-ballance all the publick concernments of Chriſt and his Church.</p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:42108:167"/>
                  <p>But O yee poor deluded people conſider, Hath not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt been already too much diſhonoured by your needleſs diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but that you will have him to diſhonour himſelf by varying from his wonted courſe in the ordering of his Church? Hath not the peace of his poor Church been too much diſturbed, and Chriſtian Charity too much violated heretofore in the late times of Schiſme,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Vines.</note> when (as one of the prime Leaders amongſt you ſaid then too truely) It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Popery to ſpeak of it? This was indeed the old mark (for <hi>by this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, <hi>if yee love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>) But the truth is, it was almoſt worn out, and inſtead thereof <hi>Infelix Lolium,</hi> unhappy Feuds, Quarrels, Diviſions, Rents abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: What fruit had you then in thoſe things whereof you have been aſhamed, that you will now return unto them again, rather then to joyn with your Brethren in things that are indifferent?</p>
                  <p>It was a ſweet and Chriſtian reſolution of devour Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> when he ſaw differences ariſe that might cauſe a breach between him and others with whom he had formerly held a brotherly correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, He wrote unto them in theſe Words, <hi>Adharebo vobis etſi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litis, adharebo vobis et ſi nolim ipſe,</hi>

                  <p>If it be ſo that you have any peculiar priviledge granted unto you from heaven above others, to go in untrodden paths by your ſelves, to diſavow that order and government under which the Church hath flouriſhed in former times, and to diſſolve all ancient bonds of unity and Chriſtian ſociety in the publick worſhipping of our God (as ſome by their violent Impulſes of ſpirit, others by their Enthuſiaſms have pretended to have) let it be produced that we may believe you. But as the Apoſtle puts the queſtion, ſo may we. <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi> How is he then the Same?<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13</note> Hath he been with his Church ever from the beginning, exerciſing his Power in the eſtabliſhment of order and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in it, without which I ſay again it could not well have been ſo long preſerved, promiſing alſo that he will be with it, for that end and purpoſe, to the end of the world? And hath he given a countermand

                     </gap>pneſs of contradicting ſpirits, I know not what will. And if when men ſee what the Lord hath done, and hear what God the Lord, that is, God which is the Lord,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt doth ſpeak, who doth uſe to ſpeak peace unto his people and to his Saints, to ſpeak it as a Comforter, and to ſpeak it as a Counſellour (for it hath always been the earneſt deſire of his ſoul to ſee his people live peaceably one with another) they will neither acquieſce in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor follow his counſel, What ſhall we judge of them, but that they are willing not onely to turn but to run after folly, and that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in vain janglings, which do miniſter endleſs debates, rather then godly edifying?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this will afford ſtrong conſolation for all that do live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, both in reſpect of themſelves, and their poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for themſelves. When we ſinde much uncertainty in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Comforts about us, This may be our rejoycing and our refuge, that Chriſt will be the Same unto us for ever. Though friends may fail, though means may fail, though health may fail, though heart may ſail, yet Chriſt will never fail. Look what <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake, but did not perform, Chriſt hath ſpoken, and will ſurely make good, Though all forſake thee, yet will not I. Let therefore that ſweet and precious Promiſe be laid up in the heart of every true believer as a cordial to comfort it in all changes and troubles whatſoever that may ariſe, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not onely by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, for poſterity. We may rejoyce in this that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will have as tender a care of them, as he hath had of us before them, becauſe he is the Same for ever. He will be the Same to inſtruct and teach them, the Same to defend and protect them, the Same to ſave them from their ſins, and to bring them to glory. Thus argueth
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42108:168"/>the Prophet,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.27, 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.27. which the Apoſtle applieth unto Chriſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.10, &amp;c <hi>Thou art the Same, and thy years ſhall have no end. The children of thy ſervants ſhall continue</hi> (under thy protection and proviſion) <hi>and their ſeed ſhall be eſtabliſhed before thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shortly then, Is not this exceeding great comfort to godly parents in all ages, That Chriſt will be a guardian to their children after their deceaſe? They ſhall not be left (as we ſay) to the wide world, neither ſhall ſuch parents be like unto him of whom the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh, <hi>who ſhould have none to favour his fatherleſs children:</hi> But becauſe Chriſt is the Same for ever, he will, as he hath done, ever take care of his people that are in Covenant with him, not onely making his Work appear unto his Servants, but his Glory alſo unto their Children: For he remembreth his Covenant for ever; the Word which he com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manded (<hi>viz.</hi> his Angels to obſerve in the preſervation of his people,<note place="margin">

                  <p>I anſwer ſtill, Jeſus Chriſt will be the Same for ever unto his Church, that is to ſay, Not onely in this world, but in that alſo which is to come.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe let us briefly conſider two things: Firſt the full ſenſe and utmoſt extent of the Apoſtles words here <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for Ever. Secondly how Chriſt will be the Same unto his Church in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>As touching the Firſt, We muſt know that the Original word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (which is as much as to ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Always Being) literally ſignifies an Age (which Engliſh word is obſerved to have ſome affinity with that Greek termination) and an Age of what extent ſoever it be, hath an uninterrupted being. Now this word being here put in the plural number, may probably intend the ſeveral ages of both worlds, Firſt of this preſent world, together with the ſundry revolutions that are in it, one generation paſſing, another ſucceeding: And ſecondly, of the world to come.</p>
                  <p>This ſenſe I conceive with ſubmiſſion may be allowed; for where the word is put in the ſingular number, there is often intended the one world, or the other; Sometimes it is put for this world, as <hi>Luke</hi> 20.34. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20.

The ſame ſenſe and meaning very probably do the words of our Text likewiſe carry, for the Mediatorſhip of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to which they do referre, hath and ſhall have its virtual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between God and his Saints for ever in this world, and as we ſhall preſently ſhew, for ever in the world that is to come.

                  <p>The ſecond thing to be conſidered is, How Jeſus Chriſt will be the Same to his Church for ever in the world to come. For ſeeing, as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24.28.</note> 
                     <hi>He muſt reign till all enemies are put under his feet,</hi> and <hi>That when all things are ſubdued unto him, he ſhall deliver up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to God even the Father, that ſo God may be all in all,</hi> we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that there ſhall be a change in him, and conclude that therefore he cannot be the Same.</p>
                  <p>But let us not be too forward to conclude before we have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the premiſes aright, as we ought to do.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore to allude unto what I ſaid before, As Jeſus Chriſt is the Same to day under the Goſpel, which he was yeſterday under the Law, but in a different way of the diſpenſation of the myſterie of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; ſo he will be the Same to his Church for ever in heaven, but not after the ſame manner. As <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered up his diſpenſation unto Chriſt, when the myſtery of God was tranſlated from the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to the Subſtance, from the letter to the Spirit, ſo will Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the kingdome to the Father, when by his Spirit he hath done all that the Father appointed him to do: Yet as he was, under <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> the Same in effect to his Church which he is now, ſo will he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Father; Not indeed ſo darkly with ſuch glimpſes of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and ſecret illapſes of his Light and Love into the hearts of his people, as now, but with a more free and full manifeſtation of his own and his Fathers glory, without the leaſt interpoſition of any let or hinderance whatſoever; For now, ſaith the Apoſtle, we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Beatifical Viſion as Chriſt hath here obtained for us by his Merit, ſo will he for ever
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42108:169"/>hereafter be the efficient cauſe of the uninterruptible continuance thereof unto us, by his being in us.</p>
                  <p>But that I may not ſeem to deliver any thing in ſo important a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without my warrant, let us ſearch the Scriptures, and ſee what Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony they give of Jeſus herein. It is not expedient to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to ſpeak of thoſe things which we have not ſeen. <hi>It doth not yet appear</hi> (ſaith the Evangeliſt) <hi>what we ſhall be,</hi> much leſs can we be able fully to diſcern what the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be, either in his Subjection to his Father, or in his Relation to us, when God ſhall be all in all: Good therefore is it for us to be wiſe unto ſobriety, and to content our ſelves with what is revealed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then this we may aſſert for a moſt infallible truth, that Jeſus Chriſt will for ever be the Same in the Hypoſtatical union of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature with the Divine, even then when he hath delivered up the kingdome to God even the Father. And in this reſpect ſhall he then be ſubject to God: For otherwiſe,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28.</note> according to the word of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, ſeeing he ſubſiſteth ever in the real eſſential Form of God (ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.) is to be underſtood, as it is taken in the ſame place,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 2 6.</note> where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Form of a ſervant) he ſhall, as he hath ever been, according to his proper right, without any injurious encroachment upon the Father, be equal with him. Though I confeſs his ſubjection to the Father is not limited to this ſenſe, as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
                  <p>From which Hypoſtatical Union of his two Natures, ſo inſeparably to be continued unto all Eternity, Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory will undoubtedly ariſe to all thoſe, who are of the ſame Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with him, that ſhall be accounted worthy to obtain that world. O what a happineſs will it be to behold this our Lord and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kinſman ſitting at the right hand of the Throne of God, exalted ſarre above all Principalities, and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every Name that is named? Yea and from hence it will come to paſs that the Divine nature, whereof by Chriſt we have been made partakers in the ſtate of Regeneration, ſhall never ceaſe to have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us, but ſhall be perfected rather by his Preſence, and our Viſion of him: For when we ſhall ſee him as he is, we ſhall be like him, to the full extent of our ſuſceptibility of his Likeneſs, and the immediate
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42108:170"/>irradiation of his Light and Power ſhall overſhadow us, and transform us into the ſame Image both in ſoul and body. This, this I ſay is the complement of our future happineſs, the perfection of our eternal glory. And this the Apoſtle clearly teſtifies concerning our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that even they ſhall be made like unto his glorious body,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. From whence we may ſafely collect, that as the Image of Chriſts body ſhall poſſeſs our bodies, ſo ſhall the Image of his ſoul poſſeſs our ſouls, and the Image of his ſpirit our ſpirits: Whereupon it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, we ſhall be wholly poſſeſſed with his Glory, when we ſhall ſee him as he is, in the Glory of the Father.</p>
                  <p>He ſhall then be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Same in himſelf reſpecting his Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence (which as I have ſaid will infinitely tend to the advancement of the Saints happineſs) and then alſo the Same to his Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting his Power, though in the exerciſe and adminiſtration of it, he be not the Same.</p>
                  <p>His Power I ſay both over us, and in us. Over us he is now, as our Head to guide and govern us, ſo he will be then; for his Headſhip o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Church, as his preheminence over the creatures he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh, neither will the Father deprive him of it, even when God ſhall be all in all.</p>
                  <p>And this I conceive to be undeniable (though it may ſound ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto ſome) for the Humane nature of Chriſt being eternally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Divine, it is not to be imagined, that, as Man, he ſhould be in an equality with the Saints, but have a ſuperiority over them, and to be the Head of that Triumphant Church unto all Eternity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any office that belongs unto that Honour, is inconſiſtent with the dignity and wiſdome of the Sonne of God.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhould now require an account of the particulars wherein Chriſt will hereafter do the office, and exerciſe the authority of a head over the Church Triumphant in Heaven, I muſt tell them, They are to ſtay for an anſwer to their too curious queſtion till in Heaven we come to ſee him, as he is; for then, and not before ſhall we know even as we are known 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs in the generall, this we know for the preſent, Jeſus Chriſt ſhall then be the head of his Church alone without any Power ſubordinate unto him, as now; For, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>All Rule, and all Authority and Power</hi> (both Celeſtial and Terreſtrial) <hi>ſhall then be taken away:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24.</note> No humane Ordinance or Government, of whatſoever

                     </note> though now (as ſome conceive) they have divers offices aſſign'd unto them, according to the diverſity of their names and titles for the diſcharge of their Miniſtery, to which they are appointed of God,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.13</note> for thoſe who ſhall be heirs of Salvation;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.14.</note> yet when all the heirs are ſettled in their Inheritance, they ſhall then be deveſted of all their Rule, Authority and Power,<note place="margin">Bruno.</note> their very Titles of diſtinction utterly cancelled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulled (for to the Angels ſhall not be put in ſubjection the world to come) and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, As a Head he will preſerve and uphold all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his myſticall Body in their glorious Being; for as all things viſible and inviſible both in Heaven and in Earth were made by him, and for him, ſo <hi>by him muſt they conſiſt,</hi> Col. 1.16.17.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, As a Head he will keep them in a perfect unity together that they may be one according to the Divine Patterne before them, <hi>As the Father is in him, and he in the Father,</hi> Joh. 17.21.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As a Head he will ſhew unto them thoſe glorious Myſteries, which for the preſent, are beyond their reach and capacity, ſo as they ſhall be plain and obvious unto them. To which particular Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> (whoſe judgment in the Interpretation of holy Scripture is worthy of all acceptation) beareth his witneſs, whom I find giving the ſenſe of our Saviours words in his Prayer to his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.26. in this manner, <hi>Clarificavi illis nomen tuum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have Declared unto them thy name</hi> (that is, ſaith he, <hi>In this World, ſo far as they are able to receive it) And I will Declare it</hi> (that is, ſaith he) <hi>In the world to come more perfectly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea give me leave to add one Meditation more touching this weighty matter, which I confeſs I received long ſince from a Divine of eminent Note, in his writing unto me. <q>In Glory, ſaith he, The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Head and members between Chriſt and us ſhall not ceaſe, but ſhall be rather perfected by the enjoyment of that for which God did appoint it; which is the ſhedding abroad of his love upon thoſe that are made conformable to the Image of his Son.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.</note> For the end and aime which God hath in the decree of Election, is to make thoſe whom he did fore-know and predeſtinate to be conformable to the Image of his Son, that he might be the firſt-born among many Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Now when God ſhall have accompliſhed this aime, and we ſhall be fully conformable to the Image of his Son, then ſhall we be
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42108:171"/>ſuſceptible of the Love wherewith he loveth his Son, as he is Man (for the love wherewith he loveth him, as God, none can partake of, but he alone) and when by this conformity to his Image we ſhall be ſuſceptible of this Love, then the brother-hood between Chriſt and us ſhall not ceaſe, or be made void, nor ſhall then his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of being the firſt-born among many Brethren be taken from him, but it ſhall rather be moſt gloriouſly compleated, when not onely the Fathers Love wherewith he loveth the firſt-born ſhall be extended to all thoſe that are fully conformable unto his Image, but alſo the Love of the firſt-born himſelf ſhall have its full and glorious Influence upon his younger Brethren. By all which it is clear, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt will be over his Church Triumphant in Heaven, as he is now over his Church Militant here on Earth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, As he will be then over us, ſo likewiſe he will be in us. In us he is now by Faith, but Faith which gives him entertainment in our hearts, and Hope which attends upon him there, ſhall vaniſh with this Life and expire in their Service, as being of no uſe in Heaven (for Faith is of things not ſeen, and therefore ceaſeth when viſion cometh, Hope alſo if it be ſeen is not Hope) onely Love remaineth to be the conſtant Bond of an eternal Union betwixt Chriſt and us, and by love it is that he will take Poſſeſſion of our hearts in Heaven, as he doth by faith here upon Earth.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Love</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>never faileth:</hi> Not the Love of Chriſt to his Church, nor the Churches Love unto Chriſt even in reſpect of their relation to each other begun here in this life, ſhal ever ſuffer the leaſt diminution.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſay the love of Chriſt to his Church, as it is his myſtical Body, ſhall never be out-dated: For amongſt us ſaith the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.16.</note> 
                     <hi>He hateth putting away,</hi> therefore much leſs will he himſelf give his Church in Heaven, when he hath preſented it a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle or any ſuch thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Bill of Divorce, but will ever own her, and delight in her, as his beloved Spouſe, having loved her, he loveth her unto the end, yea, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the end to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>And for the Churches love unto Chriſt in Heaven, How can it choſe but be more enlarged? Partly becauſe ſhe will ever look upon Chriſt, as one that had been when time was, her faithful Mediator, and with eternal acclamations will applaud him, as her Saviour, who hath brought her to life and immortality when ſhe was near unto
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42108:171"/>death and everlaſting ruine. But chiefly becauſe the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherewith he loved Chriſt ſhall,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job.</hi> 17.26.</note> according to Chriſts own pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, be in her, that is, take full poſſeſſion of her, and conſequently as it is added in the ſame place, will Chriſt himſelf be in us likewiſe, as the bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſult of that infinite love of the Father towards his Elect people.</p>
                  <p>For a further opening of this extraordinary point, and becauſe it hath not had that regard given unto it, as it deſerveth, it being ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thought upon, I ſhall here crave leave to write the more freely of it. And firſt let me once more inſert the judgement of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Divine in his writing unto me concerning this matter, whoſe words I do offer to the conſideration of the wiſe and godly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Saints ſaith he (ſpeaking of their eſtate in Glory after the reſurrection) are ſealed up to God by his name formerly written in their forehead, as it is <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1.</note> Nor is the name of the Father onely ſaid to be written upon them, but the new name of Chriſt is alſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon them, and the name of the new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which cometh down from Heaven, as it is <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. And their names once written upon them ſhall never be blotted out again, therefore Chriſt ſhall be for ever in them, by his name written upon them;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12.</note> For by the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their names upon them, they are fitted to receive eternally the influence of the Fathers and the Sons love. And I conceive that when the work of Chriſts Mediation ſhall be at an end, and that Chriſt ſhall give up all thoſe whom he hath brought to glory, unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Father may be all in all in them, That then Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as to them ſhall receive a new name, by which he ſhall be in and over them for ever: For Chriſt as he is the head of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to purchaſe life eternal to all that are to be brought unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo now ſince he hath purchaſed that life, he hath gotten a name above every name: And when he ſhall have brought all the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the poſſeſſion of the life prepared for them, then ſhall they become his fulneſs, and by their conjunction to him, he ſhall have a new ſtate of glory, as the fruit and effect of his Mediatorial admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration ſhining upon him; which I take to be his new name, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> then alſo ſhall be written upon his redeemed for ever, And they ſhall be exalted to ſit with him in his Throne, as he was exalted, and ſat with his Father upon his Throne <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21.</note> By all which (ſaith the ſaid writer) I conceive it is evident, that in the ſtate of eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſt ſhall be in us, as the fountain and head-ſpring of life eternal
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42108:172"/>unto all mankinde, over whom (by and in the Fathers love and name which he hath declared unto them, and put upon them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for ever, and to be all in all with them) He ſhall ſhine in his own everlaſting love and new name.</q> Thus he.

For the Father and the Son are not at ſo great a diſtance, but that both may reign together. <hi>Regnat Pater in Filio, regnabit Filius in Patre</hi> (ſaid <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> well upon the Place) <hi>The Father reigneth now in the Son, the Son ſhall hereafter reign in the Father:</hi> The Scepter indeed ſhall be changed, and the form of Government altered, but of his Kingdome there ſhall be no end, rather it ſhall be more glorious then it is now, when all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being ſubdued, Jeſus Chriſt ſhall without the Miniſtery of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or men, by his own Light, Love, Life and Power immediately with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, fill and govern all his Saints for ever.</p>

                  <p>Let us now conſider what it is for the Son to deliver up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Father. It is even that which the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10.</note> then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all, whence it followeth that this ſubjection is the ſame with the delivery up of the Kingdom. An interpretation therefore here ſeems to be neceſſary, that the Son may be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be ſubject to the Father, and yet nevertheleſs that he may be ſaid to have an everlaſting Kingdom, which may be called the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Son: becauſe then at the Name of Jeſus every knee muſt bow of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the Earth.</p>
                  <p>When all things do confeſs the Lord Jeſus, and are made ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, whether it be by conſtraint, or by conſent, then ſhall the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of one God be made manifeſt unto all, and all praiſe ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound unto the Father, of whom are all things; that ſo, when preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (that is the creatures ſervice in proclaiming the Name of God)
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42108:174"/>ſhall ceaſe, the one onely God may be known in the myſtery of the Trinity. For when all rule and all authority and power ſhall bow the knee to Chriſt, then ſhall the Son manifeſt himſelf that it is not he of whom are all things, but that he is his Son, and that in him, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is to be ſeen (according to his own words,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.10) This then is the ſubjection and the yeilding up of the Kingdome: Chriſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth himſelf unto the Father, proclaiming the Father to be he of whom are all things, confeſſing alſo that he himſelf is of him. For ſo great Majeſty and Glory will appear in the comming of the Son, that all the powers of Heaven, and company of Angels may poſsibly look upon him as God alone. But our Saviour when he ſhall ſay, I am not he, that is, the Father, but his Son, he delivers up the Kingdome to the Father, and yet continueth to be King ſtill. Herein then I ſay is manifeſted both his ſubjection, and his delivery up of the Kingdome; becauſe when he profeſſeth that he himſelf is of the Father, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that whatſoever he hath is of the Father, aſcribing unto him the glory of being the complement of all things.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this the ſame Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> adds yet another ſenſe concerning Chriſts delivery up of the Kingdome to the Father, interpreting the ſaid Kingdome for the people of the Kingdome, that is, his charge of the Elect Saints, which he received of the Father, not ſuffering one of them to be loſt,<note place="margin">Ad <hi>Oro.

                  <p>Now whether we underſtand the Apoſtle in this ſenſe or that other before (either of which we may ſafely adhere unto, and unto one or both of them without queſtion muſt the words of the Apoſtle be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced) we may conclude infallibly that Chriſts delivery up of the Kingdome to the Father ſhall not deprive him of that power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which he had before over his Church, but that he ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be King thereof unto all eternity.</p>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42108:174"/>bringeth perfection; wherein ſhall be a clearer demonſtration of Chriſts Power and Wiſdome in the governing of his Church then is poſſible now to be diſcerned; For as <hi>Luther</hi> upon theſe very words of the Apoſtle, ſaith well, <hi>Eſt idem hic in Terris regnum, quod poſtea in Coelis futurum erit, niſi quod jam contectum oculis noſtris non pateat.</hi> It is the ſame Kingdome here upon Earth, which ſhall be hereafter in Heaven, but that we are not able now abiding in this mortal and ſinful eſtate to perceive it being hidden from our eyes.</p>
                  <p>I could multiply Authours both Ancient and Modern who do all agree in this, that when Chriſt delivers up the Kingdome to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he then onely layeth down his Mediatorial Office, not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer the Fathers Deputy in the governing of his Church, but that his Kingdome notwithſtanding ſhall everlaſtingly be the Same: The ſame in the manifeſtation of his Wiſdome, Power, Love, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards his redeemed people to all eternity. Onely how and wherein he will exerciſe the Authority of a Head over his Church o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then is before related, there is none that is wiſe unto ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that will ſpeak of it, or be inquiſitive after it. Such knowledge is too wonderful for us, it is high, we cannot attain unto it.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore let all the ends of the Earth, that is,<note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the World farre and near, Look unto Jeſus, and be ſaved Conſider him in his Divine Nature,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Look unto him then I ſay, that you may more and more long after his apperance, love him, and delight in him.

                  <p>Worthy is this our Jeſus that we ſhould continually look unto him. He looks unto us in all our afflictions and ſupports us in them, In all the deadly hazards that we are liable unto through the malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and preſerves us from them, In all our backſlidings, and recovers us out of them, In all the duties of Religion, and by his ſpirit enables us unto them, In all the works of our callings, and commands a bleſſing upon them. Without him we can do nothing, without him we are nothing, without him we can hope for nothing: He looks upon our graces, the fruits of his own ſpirit in us, and cheriſheth them; upon our infirmities and pities them, upon the purpoſes, inclinations, deſires of our hearts towards him, and delights in them; upon our bodies and ſouls and will undoubtedly ſave them. Should his eyes then run to and fro amongſt us, and be ſtill ſet upon us for good, and ſhould not we look unto him again?</p>

            <p>The ground upon which we do in the name of God proceed, is this. If <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets be of account with the Jews, or the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles of any value with us, there may be great hope for the Jews to expect, and good warrant for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their reſtauration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Hear what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith of this people <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.30.31. <hi>When thou art intribulation</hi> (as they are this day) <hi>and all theſe things are come upon thee,</hi>

            <p>Poſſibly it will be replyed, That promiſe was attended with this Proviſo, If they turn unto the Lord their God, and be obedient unto his voice; But that will never be becauſe of the hardneſs of their hearts, to which they are given up by the juſt judgement of God for their contempt of the Goſpel, when it was ſent unto them.</p>

            <list>
               <item>Firſt, Theſe promiſes doubtleſs are grounded upon the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (for the old admits of no mercy to be ſhewed unto any upon the violation of it) The condition therefore muſt be underſtood in an anſwerable ſenſe, If you return, and if you obey, that is, when thou ſhalt Return, and when thou ſhalt obey, being induced
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:42108:177"/>thereunto by that Grace which I will give unto thee.</item>
               <item>Secondly, Of whom ſpeaketh Moſes this? Of ſome few, a Tribe or two of the Children of Iſrael, or of the whole Nation? Surely of the whole Nation; but hitherto is not the Captivity of the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion turned, neither hath the Lord gathered them from all thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the utmoſt parts of heaven, whither he had in his ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure ſcattered them.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, Circumciſion being the Sacrament of initiation whereby this people were ſeparated from the World, and ſolemnly admitted to be a peculiar portion to the Lord, the promiſe here of circumciſing their hearts doth not ſo much imply their confirmation in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence during their reſtored eſtate, as the turning of their hearts even at the time of their re-admiſſion to be the Lords.</item>
               <item>Fourthly, This promiſe hath never yet been fulfilled in any of their former deliverances: For Saint <hi>Steven</hi> ſpeaketh to them in this manner, after all that God had done for them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51.</note> 
                  <hi>Yee ſtiff-necked and uncircumeiſed in heart and ears, ye do alwayes reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, as your fathers did, ſo do yee.</hi> It remaineth therefore that the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof is yet to come, <hi>viz.</hi> In theſe latter dayes. Thus Moſes.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Prophets likewiſe with one Conſent do teſtifie the ſame.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Iſaiah is very free and copious in this matter. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſ.</hi> 11.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>in that day</hi> (Eſ. 11.11, 12.) <hi>that the Lord ſhall ſet his hand again the ſecond time, to recover the remnant of his people that ſhall be left, from Aſſyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cuſh, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the Iſlands of the Sea,</hi> that is, from all quarters of the World. <hi>And he ſhall ſet up an enſign for the Nations, and ſhall aſſeble the outcaſts of Iſrael, and gather together the diſperſed of Judah, from the four Corners of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us here alſo take notice of ſome conſiderations very pertinent, as I conceive, to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Prophet we ſee ſpeaks of the ſecond time of Gods ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his hand for the deliverance of all the poſterity of Jacob, which ſecond time muſt be in the dayes of the Meſſiah, as appeareth by the tenth verſe. Secondly, Obſerve this place is not to be underſtood of the elect both Jew and Gentile (as ſome will have it) For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had in the tenth verſe ſpoken particularly of the Gentiles. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:42108:178"/>the people here intended are without controverſie onely the ſeed of Abraham according to the fleſh. Thirdly, Conſider how the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks not of Judah alone, or the two Tribes that came out of <hi>Babylon</hi> after the ſeventy years Captivity, but (which is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, not onely here but in ſundry other places) of Iſrael and Judah toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who never yet were united ſince their firſt ſeparation. Fourthly, This aſſembling and gathering of Iſrael and Judah toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be in thoſe dayes, when the Lord ſets up an enſign for the Nations, that is, when the Meſſiah ſhall be lifted up in the Miniſtery of the word, For <hi>he is the rock of Jeſſe, which ſhould ſtand for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the peoples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See another Prophecy from the ſame hand <hi>Eſ.</hi> 43.5, 6. <hi>Fear not,</hi> ſaith the Lord to Iſrael, <hi>for I am with thee, I will bring thy ſeed from the Eaſt, and gather thee from the Weſt, I will ſay to the North, give up, and to the South, keep not back, bring my Sons from far, and my Daughters from the ends of the earth.</hi> And again Eſ. 45.22, 2a. <hi>Look unto mee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſ.</hi> 45.22.25.</note> 
               <hi>and be yee ſaved all the ends of the earth, In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let it be now hereupon conſidered, Hath there been as yet an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal gathering of Iſrael to the Lord, ſuch as is here mentioned? Hath the Lord as yet juſtified all the ſeed of Iſrael, that is, the Nation of them againſt their enemies? Or doth the Nation yet glory in that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which hath been wrought in the world now in the time of the Goſpel? If not, then ſurely theſe things are yet to be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>If it be objected (as ſome will not ſtick to do it) that theſe and the like places are to bee underſtood Synechdochically, as putting a part for the whole, <hi>viz.</hi> Iſrael for the whole Church of God throughout the World, that it ſhould be gathered and juſtified, and that all the people of God ſhould glory and make their boaſt of the Lord. I anſwer, Though it ſhould be ſo, yet the literal meaning here, as it referreth to the poſterity of Jacob, is not to be wholly ſleighted; for admit, that it be an uſual form of ſpeech by a Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche, to put a part for the whole, Yet ſuch a Synechdoche muſt needs be accounted a violent aſſault upon reaſon, and was never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard of, as that a part ſhould ſignifie the whole, when that part which ſhould expreſs the whole is not included, but ſhut out from it: doubtleſs in all Synechdochichal ſpeeches the part ſet down
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42108:178"/>for the whole muſt be always a part of it: as when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Yee ſhall ſee my face no more</hi> Act. 20. His face is a part of him, And thus muſt all other Synechdoches whatſoever be underſtood, the part ſignifying the whole muſt of neceſſity be included and contained in it. If therefore all the Nation of Iſrael here be put for all the Nations of Believers in the World, as a part of the whole, then it muſt certainly follow that the Nation of Iſrael according to the fleſh was included a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and not excluded from the whole.</p>
            <p>Let us go on, omitting for brevities ſake what might be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> to this purpoſe, wherein he hath abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Conſider how <hi>Jeremiah</hi> keepeth alſo in the ſame track. For thus ſaith he in the Name of the Lord.<note place="margin">

               <hi>In thoſe dayes the houſe of Judah ſhall walk with, or to the houſe of Iſrael, and they ſhall come together,</hi> &amp;c. And again, <hi>I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all Countryes wither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Add hereunto, <hi>Loe the dayes come, ſaith the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 30 3.9.</note> 
               <hi>that I will bring again the Captivity of my people Iſrael and Judah, ſaith the Lord, And they ſhall ſerve the Lord their God, and David their King, whom I will raiſe up unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like alſo is prophecyed by Ezekiel, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.21, 22, 23. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>behold I will take the Children of Iſrael from among the Heathen, whether they be gone, and will gather them on every ſide, and I will make them one Nation in the Land upon the Mountains of Iſrael, and one King ſhall be King over them, and they ſhall be no more two Nations, neither ſhall they be divided into two Kingdoms any more at all, and my ſervant Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid ſhall be their Prince for ever. Moreover I will make a Covenant of peace with them, it ſhall be an everlaſting Covenant with them, and I will place them and multiply them, and will ſet my ſanctuary in the midſt of them for evermore. My Tabernacle alſo ſhall be with them, Yea I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people, and the Heathen ſhall know that I the Lord do ſanctifie Iſrael, when my Sanctuary ſhall be in the midſt of them for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again (Jer. 31.1, 4.) <hi>At the ſame time ſaith the Lord,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.1, 4.</note> in the later dayes (as appears Jer. 30.24.) <hi>I will be the God of all the families of Iſrael, and they ſhall be my people; Again I will build them
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42108:179"/>and thou ſhalt be built O Virgin of Iſrael, thou ſhalt be again adorned with thy Tabrets, and thou ſhalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I willingly paſs by many other places that might be alledged, for it would be too much to inſert all that is written thereof.</p>
            <p>But I demand, Hath any of theſe things as yet come to paſs? When was it that the houſe of <hi>Judah</hi> did walk with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> together, ſince the time they were divided one from the other in the days of <hi>Rehoboam?</hi> Hath the Lord as yet gathered the remnant of his flock out of all Countryes, whither he hath driven them, or ſet up ſhepheards over them, to ſeed or to defend them, ſo as they ſhould fear no more, nor be diſmayed? Do <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> this day unanimouſly ſerve the Lord their God, and <hi>David</hi> their King, that is, the Meſſiah <hi>David</hi>'s Son (as Interpretersiboth <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and Chriſtian expound it) of whoſe government and peace there ſhall be no end? Hath God ſet his Sanctuary in the midſt of them, or pitched his Tabernacle among them, ſo as the Heathen do take notice of it, that it is the Lord that doth ſanctifie <hi>Iſrael?</hi> If his Sanctuary hath been among ſome of them, it hath been again removed, but here it is ſaid, his Sanctuary ſhall be in the midſt of them for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: In fine, Hath God as yet in theſe latter dayes declared himſelf to be the God of all the families of Iſrael ſince their defection from him, and own'd them again for his people? Is this Virgin as yet repayred, ſince ſhe was ſtript of her ornaments, or hath ſhe yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſht over and trimmed up her Tabrets, that ſhe might rejoyce at her reſtauration?</p>
            <p>If none of all theſe things I ſay be yet come to paſs, and the word of God cannot be retracted, they are yet to be fulfilled, and ſhall in time moſt certainly have their due accompliſhment.</p>
            <p>Yea more, that neither their diviſions amongſt themſelves, Iſrael a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Judah, and Judah againſt Iſrael, nor their inveterate ſtubbornnes againſt the Lord might be any hinderance unto them, the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> in theſe words,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39</note> 
               <hi>I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their Children after them.</hi> And by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in theſe words, <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:42108:179"/>ſhall keep my judgments and do them.</hi> Oh bleſſed and thrice happy ſhall this people be when theſe things are fulfilled. I deny not but theſe promiſes have a meaſure reaching to us <hi>Gentiles,</hi> even all among us, that are intereſſed in the new Covenant. But I ſay again the people that are mentioned cannot without violence done to the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt, be excluded from them in the dayes of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I omit what might be further added out of theſe Prophets to this purpoſe, As <hi>the viſion of dry bones in the Prophecy of</hi> Ezekiel, <hi>reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to life again:</hi> And <hi>that of two ſticks made both one in the hand of the Prophet;</hi> with ſundry other diſcoveries of the minde of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this truth, which upon an unprejudicate peruſal even by thoſe that are contrary-minded, would appear unto them to carry in them this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That this firſt-born of the Almighty, this people ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely beloved of the Lord ſhall not at this day be quite forgotten, as dead men out of minde, nor be ever divided one from another, as they have been, but ſhall reſtored again notwithſtanding the ſeeming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie of it, to their priſtine glory, and ſhall be happily re-united together into one, as becometh brethren.</p>
            <p>In the next place let us try whether the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> will afford us the like Suffrage herein, as the other Prophets have done.</p>
            <p>But before we enter hereupon give me leave to premiſe a word or two. It is not my purpoſe here to launch out too ventrouſly into this deep, I foreſee the danger that attends upon it, many of late ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt themſelves in ſo doing by a too much confidence of their skill and ſtrength, that I may not therefore fall under the guilt of raſhnes and inadvertency in this kinde with others, who have been perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in ſtating and determining the Epoche's and Periods of times men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this Book, and that of the <hi>Revelation</hi> (which have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their ſhame to be of a larger extent then thoſe limits which they have ſet unto them) I ſhall onely offer what I have to ſay to the judgement and examination of the Church, not daring to determine in a point of ſuch difficulty and uncertainty, as that is, which I am now about to inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>The place which I have ſingled out for my purpoſe is in the ninth Chapter of this Prophecy and the twenty fourth verſe; Where the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:42108:180"/>Angel who is before called the Man <hi>Gabriel;</hi> becauſe he appeared in a humane ſhape, ſpeaks unto <hi>Daniel</hi> in this manner. <hi>Seventy weeks</hi> (as it is tranſlated) <hi>are determined upon thy people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.</note> 
               <hi>and upon thy Holy City, to finiſh the Tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſins, and to make reconciliation for Iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, and to ſeal up the Viſion and Prophecy, and to anoint the moſt Holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the expoſition of which words I finde Interpreters do gene ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lly run upon this foot of account, making theſe ſeventy weeks, as they are called, to be ſeventy times ſeven years, and to begin at one of thoſe four Edicts mentioned in <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that came forth from thoſe <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs, <hi>Cyrus, Darius,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> for the reſtoring and returning of the people, and for the building of the Temple and City; wherein they do much vary one from another, and are at a great loſs in their computations, becauſe not onely the Scripture doth not afford help in this matter, not expreſſing the full years of the reign of thoſe Princes, nor yet the ſeries of their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but thoſe Hiſtorians alſo that have been of old, who (as a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Antiquary obſerveth) having ſo many,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Biſhop</hi> Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue.</note> and ſo great helps at hand, which we want, of the <hi>Perſian, Babylonian, Aſſyrian, Egyptian</hi> Writers, who at large related the acts of thoſe Princes, with whom in their times the ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> did concur, and who were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly furniſhed with Hiſtories of the <hi>Seleucidan</hi> and <hi>Lagidan</hi> Princes of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> race, with whom the <hi>Jews</hi> after the Captivity had great negotiations, have left unto us ſo very poor, or none at all helps for direction herein, in ſo much that we have little or no cauſe to thank them for it; Upon which conſideration I ſay none of our Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours before us could, nor can any man elſe to this day conclude pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely upon a certain root of time for the beginning of theſe years ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this account: nevertheleſs it is the concurrent judgement of writers that at one of theſe forementioned Edicts muſt theſe ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty weeks take their Commencement and Beginning: the final Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod whereof, which muſt be as uncertain as the Beginning, they make to be either at the coming of the Meſſiah, or at his Baptiſme, or at his Death, or at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple, the amounty of which time, ſay they, makes up 490 years, and are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the Angel branched out into ſeveral parcels, where every part hath ſome Cardinal thing of ſpecial remarke fixed unto it, that ſhould happen within that time.</p>
            <pb n="307" facs="tcp:42108:180"/>
            <p>But I ſhall now crave leave to lay down my conceptions of this Scripture, differing from the ordinary interpretation of it, believing there is enwrapped in it the whole purpoſe and determination of God concerning his <hi>Iſrael</hi> from firſt to laſt, beginning at ſome notable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poche, and to be continued untill the final reſtauration of that Nation which is yet to come.</p>
            <p>This I confeſs may ſeem ſtrange at firſt ſight, becauſe of the novelty of it: But by that time we have duely conſidered the words, as they are delivered by the Angel, it may happily be adjudged not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impertinent, and may give occaſion unto ſome of a more diligent ſearch and enquiry after a further meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in this Scripture, then as yet hath been thought upon.</p>
            <p>Obſerve then, the Prophet underſtanding by books, as he ſaith in the ſecond verſe, the number of years, whereof the Word of the Lord came to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> that he would accompliſh ſeventy years in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (which years were then expired) <hi>he ſetteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> (as ver. 3.) <hi>to ſeek the Lord God by prayer and ſupplication</hi> in the behalf of his people, and the Holy City, that mercy might at length be ſhewed unto them in their deliverance. Whereupon this anſwer is preſently returned unto him by <hi>Gabriel;</hi> but what anſwer is it? Not punctually poſitive to his prayer, which was for the aforeſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance ſo much deſired by him, now after the expiration of the terme appointed for the Babyloniſh Captivity, that ſeems to be the leaſt part of the Angels errand at this time, but becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> was a man greatly beloved, the Angel hath a matter of greater import here to reveal unto him, in which he might be aſſured that the deliverance which he prayed for ſhould alſo be included. But what is this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of greater import? Is it the happy conſequents which ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon their deliverance? Thus indeed hath it been conceived: But rather is it not (as I have ſaid, and which I ſhall undertake here to prove to be) the purpoſe of God concerning his delivering this people out of all their troubles, eſpecially thoſe which they endured in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and now alſo in their diſperſion into all Lands, where they are ſcattered to this very day, from the very time when they were firſt brought into a preparatory way of being formed into a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? As for the Holy City, that onely is inſerted in this anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prophet had mentioned it in his prayer, and the Angel ſpeaks more particularly of it in the verſes following. This with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42108:181"/>of my judgment of the Holy Catholike Church, and of my Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I conceive to be the genuine ſenſe of that Scripture, and what I have now to ſay to it, I deſire may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered without prejudice.</p>
            <p>My ſupputation of the time here mentioned is after this manner. Theſe 70. Weekes, as they are called, I take for 70. Jubilees, each of which being 49. years, they together make up 3430 years. Now if we reckon from the time of <hi>Jacobs</hi> going down into <hi>Egypt</hi> (which is the Epoche that I ſix upon, the reaſon whereof I ſhall ſhew hereafter) there will not at this time want much of compleating theſe ſeventy Jubilees.</p>
            <p>For from that time to the Incarnation of our Saviour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,<note n="*" place="margin">Which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with <hi>Alſtedius</hi> his account</note> were 1721. years, and ſince the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are 1660. Both which accounts make up 3381. So that to fill up the ſaid number of Jubilean years there remaineth but one ſingle Jubilee more, which will fall out to be in the year of our Lord 1709. About which time the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here <hi>Daniels</hi> people becauſe of his care and tender affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them) may become a people again, according to the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of Scriptural Prophecies, their iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin finiſhed and taken away through the reconciliation that ſhall be then between their God and them, in ſtead whereof they ſhall have an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs, brought in by the good hand of God upon them, whereby they ſhall become a righteous Nation for ever, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the whole Viſion and Prophecy concerning them will be ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, confirmed and concluded; and the moſt Holy, or the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Holineſſes, that is, either the Holineſs of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſurpaſſing all the Holineſſes of believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall be anointed, that is, exalted above all others, or the Meſſiah, even the Lord Jeſus, who is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of them all (for there is Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ier then the Holieſt, and there is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier then they) ſhall be anointed, that is, reign as King over them, and they by their unanimous acclamations and chearful ſubjection acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be their Sovereign.</p>
            <p>The ſenſe of this Scripture I confeſs is new, but it will not follow thereupon that it cannot be true. Yet I am not confident that it is the onely meaning of the Spirit, for then I ſhould pretend to be wiſer then <hi>Daniel.</hi> But I will wait for the determination of the Holy Church
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42108:181"/>about it, and expect till the end be, what Divine Providence will work in bringing of it to paſs, hoping to reſt, and to ſtand in my lot with <hi>Daniel</hi> at the end of the dayes.</p>
            <p>Some intricacies I know will appear in this interpretation, which I ſhall endeavour to unfold: Yet ſure I am they are not ſo many as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expoſitions are perplexed with, and ſo ſnarled that they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be reſolved.</p>
            <p>Firſt an account will be required of me why I ſhould call and reckon thoſe for Jubilees which are in our Tranſlation called Weekes. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, though the word be tranſlated Weekes (which I do not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to correct, the word having a meaſure according to Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe extending to various ſignifications) yet ſuch as are skilful in the Original do well know that theſe words may be alſo rendred thus, ſevens ſeventy are pared out for thy people. Now the Scripture ſpeakes of three ſeveral ſorts of ſevens or ſeptenaries in order to ſuch times which the Lord hath ſanctified. Firſt, the ſeventh day, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſeventh year, thirdly, the ſeventh Sabbatical year. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day was the Sabbath wherein the people were to reſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.3</note> 
               <hi>Lev.</hi> 23 3. The ſeventh year was the Sabbatical year wherein the ground reſted, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.4. The ſeventh Sabbatical year was the Jubilean Sabbath, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.8. The acceptable year above all the reſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.4. <hi>Lev</hi> 25.8. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 61.2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 49.17.</note> the year of liking or good-will, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 61.2. or as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> calls it, <hi>the year of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> or general releaſement proclaimed by ſound of trumpet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every man was to return to his Inheritance again, and every ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to his freedome, which priviledges doubtleſs brought on much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and jubilation among them: It was a year of great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſomuch that it is conceived to be the great Epoche or Cardo of their times, as the <hi>Olympiads</hi> were among the <hi>Graecians,</hi>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the principal times of note in the Holy Scripture. This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptenary therefore ſeems to be worthy of more then ordinary regard: And the rather becauſe it did likewiſe in an eſpecial manner ſhadow out our deliverance by Chriſt, which was indeed the acceptable year of remiſſion, prophecied of before, <hi>Eſ</hi> 61.1.2. and ſo interpreted by our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. As alſo thereby was ſignified our
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42108:182"/>return into the Heavenly Paradiſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43. from which we are fallen in <hi>Adam.</hi> The ſeventh year may be applied to every mans par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conſummation when his ſoule is received up into glory, but by the Jubilean Sabbath (wherein all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had their re-entry upon their Lands formerly ſold) is the general re-entry of all believers into the Kingdome of Heaven, which they had formerly forfeited by their ſins, moſt happily prefigured. Theſe things then being ſo, and the Angel leaving it undetermined which ſeven of the three it is that is here meant,<note place="margin">Did not our Saviour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude unto the <hi>70.</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilees when he ſpake of our ſorgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one another ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty times ſeven?</note> whether this great Septenary rather then that of weekes of years may not in reaſon be judged to be that which the Angel here intended, when he ſaid ſevens ſeventy are cut out for thy people, let the Church determine.</p>
            <p>As for that objection which perhaps may here be caſt in, that the Jubilean year was not ordained before ſuch time as <hi>Moſes</hi> gave out the Law to the people in the Wilderneſs, and therefore could not be reckoned on before it was in being. And that alſo, that the Jubilee was a part of the Ceremonial Law, and therefore as out of date, not to be reckoned on in the time of the Goſpel, theſe I ſay upon due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration will appear to be of no force.</p>
            <p>For firſt, the ſeventh day Sabbaths and Sacrifices were a part of the Moſaical Inſtitute, <hi>yet were obſerved by Gods people from the beginning of the World,</hi> ſo might Jubilees too, for ought that may be objected to the contrary. Yea it is apparent that Jubilees have been diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of old into two ſorts, <hi>viz. Jubilaei Mundani, &amp; Jubilaei Moſaici,</hi> that is, Jubilees of the Creation, and Jubilees of the Law; ſo that this account by Jubilees might be before the Law. But there is no need to go ſo far for an anſwer: The Angel might here ſpeak of ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of years by way of Prolepſis or Anticipation (a Figure uſual in Scripture) though there were no Jubilees to be obſerved by that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for above 200. years after <hi>Jacobs</hi> going down into <hi>Egypt.</hi> And whereas it is objected in the ſecond place, that becauſe the Jubilee is a part of the Moſaical Pedagogy, therefore it is not now to be reckoned on; I anſwer, no more do we, ſo as to obſerve it according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nevertheleſs while the world ſtandeth, 49. years will be ſo many ſtill, and no more nor fewer then they were wont to be, when <hi>Moſes</hi> gave out the Law. And the Angel might ſpeak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Phraſeology of that Age, and to the apprehenſion of the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42108:182"/>Prophet, though the Judaical obſervation of Jubilees was to ceaſe long before the expiration of the time that he was inſiſting upon. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of this. Let us proceed.</p>
            <p>The time of <hi>Jacobs</hi> going down into <hi>Egypt</hi> is (as hath been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) very remarkable, and may be eſteemed a fit Epocha for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of theſe ſeventy Jubilees. The grounds and reaſons of which conjecture, I do now here offer to conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when <hi>Jacob</hi> went down into <hi>Egypt</hi> God promiſed him to make him a great Nation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.3. And withall deſigned that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place for the performance of his word, which was there fulfilled. For thus <hi>Moſes</hi> tells the people. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Thy fathers went down into</hi> Egypt <hi>with threeſcore and ten perſons, and now the Lord thy God hath made thee, as the Stars of Heaven for multitude.</hi> Whence we may collect, this journey into <hi>Egypt</hi> was the beginning or providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial occaſion of forming this people into a Nation, and whereby God did viſibly fore-lay his deſign of proving himſelf unto them to be the great Jehovah, in giving a being to his Promiſe made before unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi> Therefore very fit to be the Epocha of the Viſion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy concerning this people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Egypt</hi> was the place where <hi>Iſrael</hi> was firſt as a Childe trained up under his Fathers diſcipline, and for the ſins wherewith they there ſinned, God made them there to paſs under the rod, and brought them firſt into the bond of the Covenant (<hi>Lev.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.3.) ſo that in all likelihood, there did the time of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trouble begin, which in the purpoſe of the Almighty, was (as the Angel here ſpeaketh) cut out and pared for this people. And as they continued in their undutifulneſs, forgetting the God that formed them, ſo was their trouble alſo continued afterwards by ſundry puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted on them in their ſeveral Generations, but eſpecially in the Babyloniſh Captivity, and to this day lengthned out in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſperſion into all Lands, where the Lord hath ſcattered them. And have we not good reaſon then to ſuppoſe that <hi>Jacobs</hi> going down into <hi>Egypt</hi> at the commandment of the Lord was eminently ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to theſe ends, that God might enter upon his work, his great work, which he had determined concerning this people? Somewhat ſurely there is in it that the Spirit would have us to take ſpecial notice of, becauſe we find it ſo often mentioned in the Scripture, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.5. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.23. <hi>Act.</hi> 7 15.</p>
            <pb n="312" facs="tcp:42108:183"/>
            <p>It may be ſaid <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo went down into <hi>Egypt</hi> two hundred and ſixteen years before <hi>Jacob,</hi> this account therefore of Jubilees may as well begin from that time as from <hi>Jacobs</hi> going thither.</p>
            <p>A negative anſwer muſt hereunto be given. For firſt, though <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet it was not at the commandment of the Lord,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſ.</hi> 105.14.15.</note> but as a traveller from one Country to another, as his affairs called him, and it was but for a ſhort time, for he went up from thence again, and which is remarkable, <hi>All that he had he brought away with him,</hi> Gen. 13.1.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Jacob,</hi> he went not thither but at the expreſs word of the Lord, and there he continued till the day of his death, and his Poſterity removed not from thence till the Lord led them forth with a ſtrong hand and ſtretched-out arm. Secondly, when <hi>Abraham</hi> went thither, God had not made known unto him the afflictions that his Poſterity ſhould endure in that Land, and therefore he might be at his liberty before, to go thither or not, as ſeemed good unto him; but when once this was revealed unto him (<hi>Gen.</hi> 15.) there muſt then be no more journeying into <hi>Egypt</hi> by theſe Patriarchs, till the very beginning of that time came, which is here by the Angel ſaid to be cut out for this people, that is as I have ſaid, for their growing up into a Nation, and ſuffering ſuch chaſtiſements which the Divine Wiſdome had appointed for them.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.2.</note> And hence it was (very probably) that an expreſs inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was given unto <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that he ſhould not go down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> as his Father <hi>Abraham</hi> had done, though it ſeems a neceſſity lay upon him to relieve himſelf and his family at that time by the plenty of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> being put to as hard a ſtrait, by reaſon of a ſecond famine in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as his Father <hi>Abraham</hi> was.</p>
            <p>Thirdly <hi>Jacobs</hi> going into <hi>Egypt</hi> was a Type of our Saviours going thither (one reſembling the other in ſundry notable circumſtances) and in that regard is the greater notice to be taken of it. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt <hi>Jacob</hi> went thither at the commandment of the Lord, ſo was Jeſus carried thither by a Meſſage from Heaven.</item>
               <item>Secondly <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a means of bringing <hi>Jacob</hi> into that Land, ſo did another <hi>Joſeph</hi> carry Chriſt into it.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, <hi>Jacob</hi> went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that being the Countrey choſen of God for <hi>Iſraels</hi> infancy, for he grew a lovely Childe, there God taught <hi>Ephraim</hi> to go, taking them by their arms, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.1.3.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42108:183"/>So was the Holy Child Jeſus carried into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to be there for a while kept at nurſe, as I may ſay, with his mother, and during his<note n="*" place="margin">Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographus ſcribit <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephum</hi> cum <hi>Maria</hi> &amp; puero Jeſu in <hi>Aegypto</hi> 7. annos ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulaſſe, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſcil. temporis debuit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plendae <hi>Herodis</hi> malitiae.</note> Minority to have that education as was meet and convenient for him.</item>
               <item>Fourthly, <hi>Jacob</hi> went thither to preſerve his life from the Famine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.5.7. And Jeſus was carried thither, to keep him out of harms-way, and to preſerve his life from thoſe that ſought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it.</item>
               <item>Fiftly, <hi>Jacob</hi> and his poſterity were to ſtay there, till the time came which the Lord had ſet for their diſmiſſion from thence, ſo Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was not to be brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> till he was called according to the ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.1. Out of <hi>Egypt</hi> have I called my Son, and word brought by the Angel for that very purpoſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.13.19.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe things being ſo, may we not infer that the time of <hi>Jacobs</hi> going into <hi>Egypt</hi> was a time of great remark in Scripture, and that it is the fitteſt of all other to make an Epocha from whence theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Jubilees are to derive their commencement and beginning.</p>
            <p>Another argument there is yet to be conſidered for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſenſe of the Angels words, taken from the end or final cauſe for which theſe 70 ſevens were determined, which is here ſaid, <hi>To finiſh the tranſgreſsion, and to make an end of ſinnes, and to make reconciliation for iniquity</hi> (that is, that no unrighteouſneſs of what kinde or degree ſoever, whether that ſingle tranſgreſſion of <hi>Jacob</hi> in the ſinful manner of ſupplanting his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> or that unnatural cruelty of his ten ſons againſt their brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi> or the numberleſs multitude of ſins, whereof they have ſince been guilty, or their moſt execrable iniquity againſt the Lord of life, and his Goſpel ſent among them, ſhould remain as a blot upon them, to cauſe any more ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between their God and them) and to bring in everlaſting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs (which will conſummate the Viſion and Prophecy) that they may be a righteous Nation, and holy People to the Lord above all others, ſo long as the World endureth.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I demand, Have theſe things as yet been fulfilled upon this People? Is their iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin (to ſpeak of it firſt in a general ſenſe) finiſhed or purged away? Yea is it at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained? Rather doth it not abound more and more? If then theſe ſeventy ſevens muſt be limited to ſo narrow a compaſs as they have
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42108:184"/>uſually been, Where is the truth of this Prophecy? Where? It is in the Meſſiah (ſay ſome) who by his death hath done all this for them: Moſt true, But nevertheleſs it ſhall not be effectual unto them till they do believe, and receive him for their Meſſiah; For <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10.4. But withall the Apoſtle there addeth that which we finde in this people to this very day,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16.</note> 
               <hi>They have not all obeyed the Goſpel.</hi> For as <hi>Eſaias</hi> ſaith, ſo may we, <hi>Who among them hath believed our report</hi> (concerning this Meſsiah) <hi>which hath been carried to the end of the world?</hi> Yea the ſame Prophet feareth not in plain terms to ſay, <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not, I was made manifeſt unto them that asked not after me,</hi> meaning the Gentiles, <hi>but to</hi> Iſrael <hi>he ſaith, All day long have I ſtretched forth my hands unto a diſobedient and gain ſaying people:</hi> This time therefore is not yet expired, becauſe their iniquity, tranſgreſsion and ſin as yet remaineth.</p>
            <p>Or if that ſingle tranſgreſſion in <hi>Jacob</hi> or his ſonnes before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned was finiſhed, having received a juſt recompenſe of reward at their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and the multiplied rebellions ſince of the Jewiſh nation, wherewith they in their ſeveral generations after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards did provoke the Lord againſt them, were ſealed up at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn out of <hi>Babylon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſo as they ſhould appear no more to their ſhame: yet their iniquity in crucifying the Lord of glory is ſtill marked before the Lord, and therefore is their preſent captivity ſtill continued. But when theſe ſeventy ſevens are ended, God will ſurely be reconciled to them for that alſo.</p>
            <p>It will be objected, How doth this Interpretation agree with the words following, where theſe ſeventy ſevens are branched out into a tripartite diviſion, and made to expire at the furtheſt with the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, Though mention be there alſo made of ſeventy ſevens, yet I conceive it will not neceſſarily follow that they muſt be the ſame with thoſe before ſpoken of, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. but becauſe the Prophet had in his prayer, beſought the Lord for the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as well as for the people, therefore after that the Angel had made known the minde of the Lord in order to the whole Viſion and Prophecie concerning the people, he then goeth on to reveal unto him in the following part of the Chapter more particularly what ſhall befall the City within
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42108:184"/>the compaſs of another ſeventy diſtinct from the former, yet included in it, wherein alſo ſhould happen the greateſt manifeſtation of Gods love unto his Iſrael: For in that time the whole Prophecy relating to the Meſſiah (who was to confirm the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and who, as the Angel ſaith, did confirm it in one week of that ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) ſhould be fulfilled. In regard therefore that this latter is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly referred to the City, both for the re-edifying and the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, and the former as punctually referred to the people for thoſe ends and purpoſes there ſpecified, as hath been proved, it may well be preſumed that they are not the ſame.</p>
            <p>Yea, the Angel himſelf ſeems to put the difference: For when he ſpeaks of the firſt ſeventy he calls upon the Prophet to underſtand the matter, and to conſider the viſion, that is, the viſion which was by the ſaid term of years to be ſealed: And when he ſpeaks of the latter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty, he again adviſeth the Prophet to know and underſtand, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that he was about to reveal another ſecret unto him touching his City which would likewiſe require his beſt underſtanding, as the other before did.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, Let it be conſidered whether this ſenſe that I have (through the guidance I hope of Gods grace) given of this Scripture, doth not carry with it a ſound of truth, according to the minde of the Spirit of God in it: which if it do, Is it not clear that the poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> (called here by the Angel <hi>Daniel's</hi> people, becauſe God would not own them during the time of his deſertion of them) ſhall ſhortly be reſtored to the honour of their Primogeniture, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Gods people again, according to the Covenant made with their fathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> which Covenant he will not break, becauſe he is 'O <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Same yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</p>
            <p>Much more might be added in the vindication of this ſenſe that I have here given, but it is time now <hi>Manum de tabula,</hi> to put an end to this matter, in the handling whereof I have already been larger then at firſt I intended, when I entred upon it: yet meet it was that I ſhould not onely give the meaning thereof according to my apprehenſion, but to clear up the difficulties of it, yea and to anſwer thoſe objections that might be raiſed againſt it: I confeſs there is a ſingularity that I may poſſibly be charged with, yet I hope I may be excuſed therein:
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42108:185"/>For firſt in ſuch dark and dubious offertures of the minde of God, as this is, no man is or ought to be bound up by the ſenſe of another, but a latitude may be taken in rendring the conſtruction of them, provided that the common Boundaries which the ſpirit of Truth hath ſet unto us in this caſe be not tranſgreſſed. Secondly I have here with all due modeſty declared my opinion after the form of an Hypotheſis, and by way of Conjecture, with ſubmiſſion alſo to the Church of Chriſt, wherein I do but as becometh a dutiful ſonne of the Church: Onely let not my humble manner of propoſing my judgement create a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in the hearts of any perſons to make them to think the more ſleightly of what I have here written. If it be but a bare conjecture that I have here offered, it is but as all other Interpretations have been that hitherto are given of this Scripture: Neither indeed was it poſſible, as I have before ſaid, that any Expoſitor could go beyond a conjecture in their Interpretation of it: For the variety of their Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's do plainly argue much uncertainty in their computations. And whereas they generally agree upon one root of time in order to their accounts, <hi>viz.</hi> The going forth of the Commandment (though when that ſhould be they cannot preciſely tell) who knows but that by the Commandment may be underſtood the Word which the Angel ſpake of before unto the Prophet, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. that came forth from God himſelf at the beginning of his ſupplications to reſtore and build <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> rather then an Edict from thoſe <hi>Perſian</hi> Princes, whom Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have ſeverally fancied to themſelves to have iſſued out for that end without warrant uncontroulable from the Spirit of God? Yea and ſome other ſenſe might yet be rendred of theſe words more then hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath been thought upon by any, which upon trial may poſſibly endure the Teſt as well as thoſe that have formerly paſs'd for currant amongſt us. But I approve of that ſage advice which an Ancient hath long ſince given, <hi>viz.</hi> It is beſt at ſome time to ſay nothing, at every time to ſay enough, but at no time to ſay all.</p>
            <p>Go we on therefore to the next, that is the Prophecy of <hi>Hoſea.</hi> In the firſt Chapter whereof, we finde that when the Lord pronounceth <hi>Loammi</hi> againſt his people, which ſhould be the laſt Abdication of them even in this their preſent diſperſion (according to the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent judgement of ſundry Expoſitors) making no other account of them then as of a heathen Nation.<note place="margin">

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:42108:185"/>this angry word which ſounds terribly to all that hear it, addeth immediately a word of comfort again, ſaying, <hi>Yet the number of the children of Iſrael ſhall be as the ſand of the ſea which cannot be meaſured nor numbred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be ſaid that this word of comfort hath reference to the Iſrael of God among the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> I anſwer, Be it ſo, yet I ſay here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the holy Ghoſt hath not ſet any ſuch limitation, as if the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Jacob</hi> were to be quite excluded. For let me ask with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Apoſtles words, Is God the God of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> onely?<note place="margin">

            <p>Yea, and if it be true that that vaſt and large part of the world cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led now <hi>America</hi> hath been the receptacle and hiding-place for the ten Tribes ever ſince their exile out of their own land (as of late it hath with very great probability been conjectured to be, ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ſame to be fore-ſignified by the Prophet <hi>Obadiah,</hi> verſ. 20.<note place="margin">Obad. v. <hi>20.</hi>

            <p>Thus have we hitherto ſeen the Prophets as with one voyce teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and proclaiming the purpoſe and counſel of God concerning the Calling and Converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the latter dayes. More Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the like nature might be produced out of the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:42108:186"/>to this purpoſe.

            <p>But becauſe there are ſome amongſt us who with much pertinacy do affirm that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall never be a people again, ſo long as the World endures (which aſſertion doth thwart the Doctrine of Chriſts Immutability which we have here maintained) hear therefore what the ſpirit ſpeaketh of it to the Churches out of the New Teſtament; For even therein alſo have we a full and clear teſtimony from the mouth of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles to aſſure us of this truth againſt all Cavils whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk</hi> 21.23, 24.</note> Then ſee what the Lord ſaith <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.23, 24. <hi>There ſhall be great diſtreſs in the Land, and wrath upon this people, and they ſhall fall by the edge of the ſword, and ſhall be led away Captive into all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Jeruſalem ſhall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See here how in wrath the Lord remembreth mercy (ſaith vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Bede</hi> upon the place) <hi>Quia non in perpetuum, donec tempora Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum impleantur,</hi> the judgement here written is not to be perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till time be no more, but onely to continue till the times of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Concerning which times, though it be true that the Father hath reſerved them to himſelf, as a ſecret not fit to be imparted to the World (in which regard it hath been and will be too much boldneſs to preſcribe the very inſtant of their expiration) yet we may ſafely ſay of them (the words of our Saviour here importing no leſs) that whenſoever they do expire, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be delivered from her bondage, and conſequently that light and gladneſs, joy and honour ſhall come upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation. Let us then for this end make a little enquiry into them, and conſider what is meant by theſe times of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Sundry conſtructions are given of them by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, nevertheleſs I doubt not but that which hath a tendency to our preſent purpoſe, we ſhall finde to be moſt genuine.</p>
            <p>Two Expoſitions I have met with, which (though the Authours
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:42108:187"/>thereof be of great note in the Church) are not in my poor judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be allowed, the one reaching beyond the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt, the other coming ſhort of it, as it ſhall here evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That which goeth too far makes the filling up of the times of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be contemporary with the final Conſummation of all things and ſo conſequently holdeth that neither the <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> ſhall ever be reſtored again. Thus the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors generally underſtand it. But againſt this it may be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, We no where finde in Scripture that the fulfilling of the times of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is rendred in ſuch a ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> For the end of the World; and in ſuch caſes the Holy Scripture hath been ſtill wont (the wiſdom of God ſo ordering it) to explain it ſelf by ſome reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and paralel places, to the end that the Church might in a form of ſound words fully know the minde of the ſpirit.</item>
               <item>Secondly, It is inconſiſtent with the Prophecies that went before concerning the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that in the time of the Goſpel, they ſhould generally ſubmit unto the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> (as we have before undeniably proved) when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be again inhabited, and made a praiſe in the earth.</item>
               <item>Thirdly it is plain that our Saviour in this 21 of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> puts a difference between the deſolation of <hi>Judea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vide <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertum</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnum ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per locum.</note> and the diſſolution of the world, making the former a portentous omen and ſad prefiguration of the latter. As therefore the diſſolution of the world ſhall be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with an eternity of reſt to all Believers, ſo (that the type may ſute the Anti-type) ſhall the deſolation of <hi>Judea</hi> be alſo attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſweet peace and happy deliverance to Gods antient people, the inhabitants of that Land even in this World before the diſſolution thereof. All which conſidered this cannot be the meaning of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in this place.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The other expoſition which I mentioned that cometh too ſhort, is given by a late learned and induſtrious writer amongſt us, Doctour <hi>Hammond</hi> by name, who affirmeth that the times of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> here fore-told by our Saviour are already paſt, having had their full end at that laſt and notable deſtruction both of the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the people, which was brought upon them by <hi>Aelius Adrianus</hi> ſixty five years after the burning of the Temple by the <hi>Romans</hi> under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:42108:187"/>of <hi>Titus</hi> the Son of <hi>Veſpaſianus:</hi> All which time of the <hi>Romans</hi> poſſeſſing the City, he makes the full extent of this word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> untill, and will have it reach no farther. For then ſaith he, <hi>Adrian</hi> rebuilt a part of the City, and called it by his own name, <hi>Aelia,</hi> inhabiting it with <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whereupon it followed, that as all the <hi>Jews</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch in oppoſition to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were utterly baniſht the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the believing <hi>Chriſtian Jews</hi> returned thither again from their diſperſions, and inhabited it again, and joyned, and made one Congregation, one Church with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which had there by that time received the faith alſo, and till then continued a diſtinct Church from the <hi>Jews.</hi> Thus he.</p>
            <p>But againſt this novel conceit, for ſo it may <hi>(Salvo honore Docti &amp; defuncti Authoris)</hi> well be called, which as I ſaid cometh ſhort of the ſenſe of our Saviour in the fore-cited place, ſome juſt exceptions offer themſelves to our conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If we examine the ſtory upon which the ſaid Authour ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his aſſertion, we ſhall finde that the truth of this Prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the treading down of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> until the times of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were fulfilled, was ſo far from receiving its final accompliſhment at that remarkable change under <hi>Adrian,</hi> that it might well be thought, it did then more then ever before, begin moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to appear. The ſtory of which times related both by Ethnick and Chriſtian Authours in ſhort is this:</p>
            <p>The Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> being willing it ſeems to vex the <hi>Jews,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an Idolatrous Temple to be erected in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> dedicating it to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and commanding withall a certain number of <hi>Romans</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foreiners, devoted to that Idol, to dwell in the City, that they might reſort unto his Temple; whereat the <hi>Jews,</hi> who till then had a toleration both for the exerciſe of their Religion, and their abode in that Countrey, being thereby much provoked (and becauſe, as ſome report, the Emperour had iſſued out an Edict againſt their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion) They brake out into open Rebellion, whereunto they were ſtirred up by a Seditious perſon, who called himſelf by the name of <hi>Barchochebas,</hi> that is, the Son of a Star, pretending thereby and making the <hi>Jews</hi> believe that he was (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) ſent to be as a light from Heaven unto them, according to the Prophecy of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and that he would deliver them out of their preſent bondage. To him they are eaſily perſwaded to yeild their Conſent, being deluded by
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42108:188"/>the ſignificancy of his name (ſaith <hi>Euſebius</hi>) and chuſing him for their Captain, they grew up into a very formidable Army. But the Emperour hearing of this inſurrection, prepares to ſuppreſs it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long and tedious war of three years and a half with theſe rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Jews,</hi> brings upon them a ſweeping deſolation: their Ring-lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (whom the <hi>Jews</hi> afterwards for his impoſture called <hi>Barchozbah,</hi> that is the Son of a lie) fell in the battel, and many thouſands of his followers (myriads ſaith <hi>Nicephorus</hi>) were by famine and ſword miſerably deſtroyed. Such of them that eſcaped were by a decree from the Emperour baniſhed for ever from that City and commanded upon peril of their lives, <hi>Ne pedem in agrum</hi> Jeroſolymitanum <hi>aliquando inferrent,</hi> not once to ſet footing any more upon that Land, or ſo much as to look towards it from any high place: And moreover to ſignifie their utter Alienation from thence, there was a Hog cut in marble, ſet upon the gate by which men go to <hi>Bethleem.</hi> In fine this City, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, being by this war utterly deprived of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient inhabitants, <hi>&amp; à peregrinis nationibus habitari coepta,</hi> and begun to be poſſeſſed by forein Nations, was afterwards made a <hi>Roman</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and the name of it changed into <hi>Aelia Capitolina.</hi> Yea ſuch a deluge of miſeries did then b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eak in upon that City and people, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, ſaith Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Comment. in Zeph. Cap. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſque ad praeſentem diem,</hi> &amp;c. even unto his time the <hi>Jews</hi> were not ſuffered to enter into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> unleſs it were to bewail the ruines of it; which admiſſion alſo once every year they purchaſed at a dear rate, not being allowed to abide there above their limited hour, and whoſoever deſired to ſtay there longer, to ſpend more tears, they were to give more money to the Souldiers that were ſet to watch them, <hi>ut qui quondam emerant ſanguinem Chriſti, emant lachrymas ſuas,</hi> that they who had before bought and ſold the bloud of Chriſt ſhould now buy their own tears, ſaith the ſame Father ſweetly in the ſame place, who there alſo very Graphically deſcribeth the manner of their lamentations: from theſe premiſes we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was now more then ever before trodden down of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Admit that ſome converted <hi>Jews,</hi> as this Authour ſaith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted thither after this change, yet that argueth not that the city was reduced again to her priſtine eſtate; for thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> were not formed into any Polity, had not the Government of the City, but the <hi>Romans</hi> ſtill kept it in ſubjection: True it is that by degrees it came to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:42108:188"/>awhile by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and was dignified with a Patriarchal ſeat, yet ſtill the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had it in poſſeſſion, and in that reſpect trod it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot. For the word here <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as learned <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerveth, is all one with <hi>Tenere jure victoriae,</hi> i. e. to keep in ſubjection by right of Conqueſt, and therefore, he from thence deriveth this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſenſe of it cannot be limited to the <hi>Romans</hi> alone, but reacheth to all others that came after them in the Conqueſt of that City, as <hi>Perſians, Saracens, Franks,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively taken it into their poſſeſſion, the <hi>Turks</hi> at this day trampling upon it, and giving it a name of their own deviſing, according to their Language, <hi>viz. Cuſumobarech:</hi> whence we may infallibly infer, that the times of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in treading down <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is not yet fulfilled.</p>
            <p>And now having weighed theſe two expoſitions of our Saviours words, and found them too light, it remaineth that we ſeek out ſome other, that is more agreable to his ſenſe and meaning.</p>
            <p>Firſt then ſhall we ſay that by the times of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is meant the times of their ignorance, and abominable Idolatries? And that as when the iniquities of the <hi>Amorites</hi> were full, God did drive out thoſe Nations from the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and according to his promiſe brought his people into it, giving it to them for a perpetual inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. So when the meaſure of the Idolatries of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> their cruelties, oppreſsions of one another and ſundry other abomina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ions that are amongſt them is come to its full length, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is here written, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall no more be trodden down, as it hath been, nor the Captivity of the <hi>Jews</hi> any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continued.</p>
            <p>Or ſhall we ſay that by the times of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may be underſtood the times of Gods patience in waiting for the Converſion of thoſe <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> who profeſsing the name of Chriſt have too much departed from his rule and government? So indeed ſaith <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tius,</hi> that the words of this Text may in ſome reſpect carry that interpretation.</p>
            <p>But becauſe theſe imply a total amputation and deſertion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> upon the reſtauration here ſpoken of, contrary to the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt in many places of Scripture, We ſhall therefore wave them alſo, and ſubſcribe unto that of <hi>Bede</hi> before-mentioned, as moſt ſound and Evangelical, wherewith we have likewiſe the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent aſſent of very good Expoſitors both antient and modern, <hi>viz.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I know well the Apoſtles have been, and are to this day charged here with an errour common among the <hi>Jews</hi> (as it is reported of them) namely, That the time ſhould come when the Meſsiah ſhould reign as Lord and King upon the Earth, according to the manner of the world; and that all Nations ſhould in that kinde be ſubject unto him, and becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were to have the preheminence among them, therefore doth the Apoſtle ſpeak here of his Dominion in this man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But I muſt crave leave to enter my diſſent unto this charge, becauſe it runs on too faſt in the world without a warrant, yea I cannot but account it too much raſhneſs to impute a fault unto thoſe eminent ſervants of Chriſt, where the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture hath not given a clear demonſtration thereof. A fault indeed here is whereof they were too guilty, in buſying themſelves about the knowledge of a time wherein they were not concerned, and for which the Lord rebukes them. But that they ſhould now (as for what they had done former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that kinde, it is not here Material) look for ſuch a temporal Kingdome of the Meſſiah, as the <hi>Jews</hi> generally did, and do ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, this I confidently deny. The grounds of which confidence will appear, when I ſhall have proved that this diſcourſe between Chriſt and his Apoſtles is a clear confirmation of the point in hand.</p>

               </gap>ight the ſenſe of this Scripture, let us conſider diſtinctly three things. Firſt, the occaſion of this Queſtion. Secondly, the perſons that put the Queſtion. Thirdly, the Anſwer unto it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the occaſion from whence the Queſtion did ariſe is couched in this word <hi>therefore, when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, &amp;c.</hi> By which word of connexion it is manifeſt that their Queſtion was not ſuddainly ſtarted as of a thing impertinent to the purport of Chriſts Doctrine, which he had been preſſing upon them in thoſe fourty dayes, ſince his Reſurrection, but rather was produced by them, as a reſult very conſonant thereunto. He had been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, as it is ſaid verſ. 3. of the things pertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, that is, of the future eſtate of his Church, for as for the Doctrine of Salvation, he had fully made that known unto them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as appears <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.15. Where he ſaith, <hi>All things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you:</hi> So that probable it is, the Subject of his diſcourſe now was, as I have ſaid, concerning his Church, giving inſtructions for the planting and governing of it, and premonitions alſo what dangers and difficulties it was like to ſuffer, and how it ſhould proſper and prevaile over them all in the latter end. And herein the Lord manifeſts his provident care and tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion which he had of his Church, reſembling thereby good old <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cob</hi> his Type (in this very particular) who when he was about to leave the world. calls upon his ſons to gather themſelves together, that he migh ſhew unto them, what ſhould befall them in the latter dayes.<note place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="326" facs="tcp:42108:190"/>
            <p>Whereas therefore the Lord Jeſus Chriſt had been ſpeaking to his Apoſtles of theſe things pertaining to the Kingdome of God, and they thereupon enquire of him concerning the reſtoring the Kingdome to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is it not paſt all gain-ſaying that ſome at leaſt of the things which he ſpake had reference to this reſtauration? Eſpecially when as it is well obſerved by <hi>Grotius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nota. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.24.</note> 
               <hi>non negat ſe id facturum, ſed quo id futurum eſſet tempore, noluit ab ipſis inquiri,</hi> he doth not deny that ſuch a thing he would do, but onely was not willing to be enquired of by them, when it ſhould be done. Much was to be done, as the ſequel now proveth, before this which they ſo haſtily ſought for could come to paſs, which they thought not of (for it could never have entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts to conceive, unleſs it had been revealed unto them,) wherein nevertheleſs they and their Succeſſours for many Ages ſhould be employed as ſervants and co-workers with Chriſt, to the end, that this much deſired reſtauration might, by the bringing in of others alſo to the faith of the Goſpel, be attended with the greater glory. And hence it is that the Lord commands them that they ſhould not depart from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (becauſe from thence was the word of life to go out into the world) till they were baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt, which was the promiſe of the Father, whereby they were to be endued with power extraordinary (as being the chief intruments under Chriſt) for ſo great a work, and to authorize others in an ordinary way to be their co-agents in it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider the perſons that put the Queſtion. Firſt, it was the Apoſtles, men not to be deſpiſed, ſuch as were <hi>legati à latere,</hi> whom Chriſt had choſen above all others to be his witneſſes of what he did and taught, and to be his Embaſſadours to carry his name into all the world, <hi>Who did eate and drinks with him after he aroſe from the dead,</hi> Act. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Apoſtles, who though they were not yet baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt, according to the promiſe of the Father, yet had received the Holy Ghoſt by Chriſts breathing on them, whereby they had not onely power given them more then ordinary, but knowledge alſo more then ever they had, to diſcern what might be moſt conduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the advancement of their Maſters honour, and ſo knew more of his minde in order thereunto, then any others could or can poſſibly attain unto.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtles altogether, not one or two of them ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:42108:190"/>from the reſt, deſirous to winde themſelves into their Maſters fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour above their fellows (as it had unhappily fallen out in former time,) but the eleven with one conſent joyned as one man to put this Queſtion unto him; for when they were come together, it is ſaid, they asked of him, ſaying, <hi>Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore again the Kingdome to</hi> Iſrael? Which Kingdome if it were never any more to have a being in this World, as a thing inconſiſtent with the manner of Chriſts Spiritual Kingdome, their general agreement about it would doubtleſs have been adjudged no better then a conſpiracy againſt the Dignity and Prerogative Royal of their Lord and Maſter, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently had not gone without a ſevere check, no more then their precipitant diſquiſition after the time did, for which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider the anſwer that the Lord giveth, <hi>It is not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for you to know the times or the ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power.</hi> Obſerve, he doth not tax them with folly and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of believing the Prophets, as he did the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus;</hi> For they after all the manifeſtations that he had made in their ſight of the mighty power of God, and the clear teſtimonies he had given, that the predictions of the Prophets concerning the Meſſiah were terminated in him, doubted nevertheleſs whether it was he that ſhould redeem <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of his troubles: But theſe believing the Prophets, being now throughly inſtructed by him concerning his Church, and aſſuring themſelves thereupon that he was ordained of God to be the reſtorer of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s liberty, without which the Church could not be compleat, he onely reproveth them for their overmuch haſte, and buſie intruſions into the ſecret counſels of the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous it ſeems before the time to be eye-witneſſes of that, as well as of all the other mighty works which Chriſt had done among them.</p>
            <p>Yea moreover, if we compare the words ſpoken to thoſe two Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, with theſe here to the Apoſtles, ſome further light may yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto us concerning this matter: To them it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.26.</note> 
               <hi>Ought not Chriſt to ſuffer theſe things, and to enter into his glory?</hi> To theſe, <hi>It is not for you to know the times or ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power.</hi> In the firſt, he implieth that the redemption of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (that is, ſuch as they meant, elſe our Saviours reply had not tended to the reſolving of their doubt) could not be accompliſhed before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:42108:191"/>into glory; For there this our Lord and Nobleman (as he is called, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.12.) went to receive his Kingdome, and there he was to rule and order all things for the benefit and advantage of his people, both of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of all other Nations in the World, according to the times and ſeaſons which the Father would impart unto him, when he was in glory. In the ſecond he intimateth that the times and ſeaſons for the bringing to paſs Gods righteous purpoſe concerning the thing which they demanded, are running on in that glory whereinto he was entring, and are guided onely by the will of the Father; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould be contented with their meaſure, and wait with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for the full accompliſhment of this deliverance, which God in his due time, beſt known unto himſelf, would ſurely bring to paſs by him, even while he is in his glory. But let us proceed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it cannot but be now expected, that that well known wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.) ſhould be produced.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</note> Let it then be examined, for it bringeth with it ſo clear an evidence in this caſe, that the Holy Spirit by it ſeemeth to remove away all doubting.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not ſtay to make any large Metaphraſe upon the Chapter (he that runs may read the ſenſe of it) let it ſuffice to take notice of the general ſcope in the whole, and to gather out of it ſomewhat that may be moſt material for our confirmation in this point we are upon, and for the conviction of thoſe that are of a contrary judgment.</p>
            <p>In the two Chapters immediately before-going the Apoſtle having written ſeverely of the rejection of the <hi>Jews</hi> (according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies that went before of them) for their rejecting of the Goſpel, he undertakes in this to mitigate the acrimony of his cenſure, to the end the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might not take occaſion to inſult over them, as if they were an abject people, given up to a final abdication: Which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotherly inſultation that he might anticipate (fore-ſeeing that it would prevaile too much, as it ſeems it doth to this very day) he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth here his meaning in plain termes, ſhewing manifeſtly what the purpoſe of God is concerning his rejection of this his ancient peculiar people, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was not to be either univerſal or perpetual; which mitigation he ſweetly inſinuates once and again in the form of a Dialogue: <hi>Hath God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>caſt away his people? God forbid. Have they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall? God forbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where, by the way, we may obſerve the Apoſtles method, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42108:191"/>his whole diſcourſe concerning this ſubject in the ſolution of theſe two <hi>Quaere's.</hi> In his treating of the firſt he proveth clearly that the rejection of the <hi>Jews</hi> was not a total rejection. In his arguing upon the ſecond, he proveth alſo as infallibly that it ſhall not be a final rejection. So long therefore as we follow the conduct of the Apoſtle herein, we ſhall not need to fear the contradiction of any other.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of his undertaking we ſhall for brevities ſake omit, and becauſe it may be judged not fully Argumentative to the point in hand: For it is not to be doubted (will ſome ſay) but that ſome of theſe caſt-away <hi>Jews</hi> might belong to the Election of Grace, as well as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and therefore may in all ages be converted to the Faith, as the Apoſtle himſelf was. That therefore which we have to ſay ſhall be derived from the ſecond, wherein we ſhall prove as undeniably that the whole Nation ſhall in Gods due time be made happy in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion alſo.</p>
            <p>Firſt then obſerve with what Authority the Apoſtle makes known his minde, not nakedly aſſerting his judgement, but like an Apoſtle indeed prefixeth his' <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> thereunto. So he did at firſt, when he entred upon this matter, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I ſay then,</hi> ſo doth he now again <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I ſay then:</hi> Thus Dictator-like as became him, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth his Sentence <hi>(tanquam ex Cathedrâ)</hi> whereby he not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives a further Explanation of his meaning, but adviſeth all ſorts of people (his Advice here being equivalent with a Command) to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in his ſaying, and to ſubcribe unto him.</p>
            <p>But what is it that he ſaith? Firſt he puts the Queſtion, <hi>Have they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall?</hi> that is, <hi>per Synechdochen,</hi> that they ſhould fall finally? Or as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> gloſſeth upon it, Is their fall ſo great that it is irrecoverable, The Anſwer hereunto follows, not by a bare Negation, but as abhorring ſuch a thought in himſelf, or in any other, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as much as to ſay, That be farre from you once to imagine, as it is from me ſo to determine.</p>
            <p>And now if the Apoſtle had ſaid no more, this verily had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſtop the mouth of all contradiction: For who is he that dares utter a word in oppoſition to the Apoſtles ſaying? But that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might not think more highly of themſelves, nor more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully of the <hi>Jews</hi> then they ought to think, behold how his heart is enlarged for his brethren his kinſmen accoding to the fleſh (as he
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42108:192"/>calls them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3.) Shewing firſt (in that which we are willing to paſs by) the Poſſibility of their Reception, ſecondly the Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it, thirdly the Certainty. The Poſſibility (as I have ſaid) he had inſiſted upon before in the beginning of the Chapter. Now comes he, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with variety of Arguments to ſhew the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Afterwards, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, <hi>&amp;c, &amp;c.</hi> he proveth the Certainty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; In the end applauding and magnifying the Wiſdome and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, his ſtupendious Wiſdome in making the Deſertion of the <hi>Jews</hi> and occaſion of calling the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and his profound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge farre beyond the reach of all the heavenly Intelligences, in knowing how to work upon the moſt obſtinate <hi>Jews,</hi> by bringing them to the obedience of the Goſpel through their envy and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This in ſhort is the ſumme of the Apoſtles undertaking. And ſhould we now follow his track throughout his whole Diſcourſe upon this Subject, though poſſibly ſome wou'd account it tedious to afford us their company; yet we ſhould not be found guilty of an inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble digreſſion from the ſubject that we have before treated of, in ſo doing. For the Text being directed to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to aſſure them of Chriſts immutability towards them (which argues clearly that he would not finally forſake them, though for the preſent they were as ſtrangers ſcattered about the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1.) The explicating therefore of theſe parallel Scriptures w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the holy Ghoſt hath record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our confirmation therein, cannot with any ſhadow of reaſon be reckoned as an impertinency, eſpecially when a point ſo material to the honour of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is called in queſtion, as it is this day. Neither indeed could that which hath been here done in order thereto have been omitted, unleſs we ſhould have betrayed the Text to the gain-ſaying of men, which God forbid. And let this ſerve for a vindication againſt all thoſe cavillers, who are ready to object im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies unto me in the allegation of thoſe Scriptures which have here been made uſe of to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs to avoyd more prolixity we ſhall not exactly trace the Apoſtle in the purſuance of this argument concerning the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </note> Whether it be not juſt and meet that God ſhould obtain his end, which he hath propoſed unto himſelf concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the diſpenſation of his mercy? <hi>He hath</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 32.) <hi>concluded them all in unbelief,</hi> that is, in his juſt Judgement ſhut them all up together, as in the very verge of hell, under the dominion of ſin: (which miſery nevertheleſs they had brought upon themſelves by their contumacy againſt him) but to what end? Was it that he might deſtroy either one or the other? No verily, but rather <hi>that he might have mercy upon them all</hi> both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> To the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were firſt in this <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>If the fall of them,</hi> that is, the <hi>Jews, be the riches of the world, and the diminiſhing of them the riches of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>how much more their fulneſs?</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>If the caſting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what ſhall the receiving of them be, but life ſeem the dead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Words indeed of an irreſiſtable conviction, unleſs we will ſay with the <hi>Laedicean,</hi> We are rich and encreaſed in goods, and have need of nothing: Alas we have need of more grace, becauſe Satan now hath more wrath then ever, having but a ſhort time to work for his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; we have need of more holineſs, becauſe the pollutions of the world are grown more filthy; we have need of more acquaintance with our God, becauſe our hearts are grown more deceitful: doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we are not ſo full, but we have yet need of more, at leaſt we have need of more brotherly love, and Chriſtian unanimity, then is at this day to be found amongſt us, and that thoſe ſchiſms and diviſions under which the poor Church of Chriſt lyeth ſtruggling as it were for life ſhould be taken out of the way. True it is we <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were before a beggarly people have upon the <hi>Jews</hi> falling into poverty been enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Divine bounty, but have not we alſo grown wanton with our wealth, gadding about after vanities that cannot profit us? When they were caſt out of favour we were reconciled to God, who were before ſtrangers, yea enemies unto him: But have not we alſo many a time vexed his holy Spirit by our treacherous Apoſtacies, as much as they? And how then ſhall this be remedied? Which way ſhall we have our
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42108:193"/>wants ſupplyed? Our breaches repaired? Our hearts more eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the truth? Doth not the Apoſtle who is of counſel with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty in this caſe, and therefore knew beſt the way of Divine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of grace toward us, doth not he I ſay tell us here plainly how all this ſhall be brought about to our exceeding great advantage, <hi>viz.</hi> by the reception of this people into favour, reſtoring them again fully to their dignity and preheminence among the Nations? Not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as a meritorious cauſe therof (that is far from the Apoſtles mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) but in a way of ſubſerviency to that providence which ordereth all things for the good of Church.</p>
            <p>And now let it be conſidered, How great is that goodneſs which God hath laid up for his people even before the Sons of Men in the latter dayes? May we not then expect a more plentiful effuſion of his Spirit in the powerful operations of it upon the hearts of Believers? And that all thoſe peſtilent hereſies wherewith the Chriſtian Churches among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have been miſerably infeſted even almoſt unto death, ſhould be thrown to the Moles and to the Bats? The jarring and jangling ſound of Schiſme no more to be heard in their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and inſtead thereof both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a moſt entire and indiſſoluble bond of Brother-hood? And when this fulneſs of happineſs ſhall come upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (as it will ſurely happen unto them upon the fulneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Apoſtle himſelf being witneſs) may it not be reckoned (according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles word) as it were a new life from the dead?</p>
            <p>I demand therefore again, Are theſe things ſo? Hath God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to advance ſo much the intereſt of his Church by the Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and is it meet that we ſhould ſtand cavilling at it? Shall this our Apoſtle thus magnifie his office, and with a paternal care of our good, argue ſo irrefragably in our behalf, and ſhould we like a company of wayward children with unkinde Recalcitrations ſpurn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his office, and our own happineſs, vilifying the one, and as much as lyeth in us nullifying the other? How theſe <hi>Quaere's</hi> may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, together with many other that might be gathered from the following branches of the Apoſtles arguing about the facility of the <hi>Jews</hi> Reſtauration, ſhall I ſay be left to their conſideration, who not onely cauſleſly call it into queſtion, but peremptorily deny that the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42108:194"/>Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall ever be reckoned among the Nations of the world any more, and ſo conſequently aſperſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with inconſtancy towards this his firſt beloved people, as if he would not be 'O' <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> unto them, the Same to the end, which he hath been from the beginning.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall ſay, That to put theſe <hi>Quaere's</hi> in ſuch a manner is to beg the Queſtion, that is, To conclude that for a truth, which is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie whether it be ſo or no. I muſt anſwer, If the Apoſtles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hitherto will not ſatisfie, and that neither Poſſibilities nor Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitics heaped together will down with gain-ſayers to draw them to a conviction, we have a more ſure word of Teſtimony given here in the cloſe, whereunto they ſhould do well to take heed, leaſt unhappily they be found even to ſight againſt God.</p>
            <p>To the end therefore that no man might in this caſe plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is commonly the mother of arrogance, Hear what the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, 26, &amp;c. <hi>I would not brethren</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that you ſhould be ignorant of this myſterie, (leſt you ſhould be wiſe in your own conceits) that blindneſs in part is happened unto</hi> Iſrael <hi>until the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be come in; and ſo all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I know well that theſe very words of the Apoſtle are alſo wreſted by ſome to another ſenſe; as there will not want cavils againſt the cleareſt demonſtrations of Truth to the worlds end. And if we ſhould give an ear to whatſoever may be ſuggeſted unto us by oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we ſhall never be free from heſitancies in the interpretation of any Scripture, nor in the aſſerting of any Doctrines, though never ſo fundamental. Let this preſent Scripture be look'd upon but with an unprejudicate eye, and be conſidered in the moſt plain and grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſenſe of it, and then ſee whether it doth not preciſely determine this point, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a time approaching, wherein the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation ſhall be reſtored, and become a glorious converted Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which God will own for his Beloved people, notwithſtanding all their unkinde rebellions againſt him.

               <item>Firſt the Apoſtle ſpeaks of this matter, as of a myſterie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould the more diligent heed be given unto it. A myſterie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is; Firſt in regard of the origination of it, being ſprung out

            <p>All <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is (not as it is conſtrued by ſome) the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God throughout the world conſiſting of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for that neither was any myſtery to thoſe, unto whom this Epiſtle is written, who knew full well by dayly experience that multitudes of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> together with ſome of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation were converted to the faith, and by conſequence ſhould undoubtedly be ſaved; yea
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:42108:196"/>if this conſtruction ſhould be admitted, the Apoſtle had receded from his ſcope, which he aimed at throughout this whole Chapter, which was to ſuppreſs the inſolency of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to quicken the poor <hi>Jews</hi> with ſome lively hope of their reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Laying aſide therefore this miſtake, though it be fathered by many, who carry a great name amongſt us in the interpretation of Scripture, By <hi>Iſrael</hi> here is undoubtedly meant Children of the flock of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſprung out of the thigh of <hi>Jacob,</hi> thoſe whom the Apoſtle calls before v. 14. <hi>His own</hi> fleſh.

            <p>This in truth is the bottome of the myſtery that is here intended, and this ſenſe I am prone to give of it, being inclined unto it by the word of the Prophet as it is alledged by the Apoſtle, <hi>viz. There ſhall come out of</hi> Sion <hi>a deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, <hi>for this is my Covenant with them, when I ſhall take away their ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words three things are of ſpecial remark.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Apoſtles varying from the Prophet in the allegation of his teſtimony; for this will be of ſingular uſe to our preſent purpoſe. The Prophet had ſaid, <hi>a Redeemer ſhall come,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>there ſhall come a Deliverer; a Redeemer ſhall come to</hi> Sion, ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>there ſhall come a Deliverer out of</hi> Sion, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>to thoſe that turn from ungodlineſs in</hi> Jacob, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>to turn away ungodlineſs from</hi> Jacob, ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>And why is there ſo much diſparity may ſome ſay between them?
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:42108:197"/>Should not the Apoſtle, ſince he will corroborate his aſſertion from what is written by the Prophet, produce his teſtimony exactly without any alteration? I anſwer, the ſpirit of truth, alwayes One and the Same, wherewith theſe Actuaries and Pen-men of Holy Writ, were guided, knew beſt in what termes to expreſs the purpoſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God concerning his people, both in the times of the Law, and of the Goſpel:<note place="margin">Diſtingue tempora &amp; concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabunt ſcripturae.</note> Hence it is that the Apoſtle is here made the Prophets interpreter rendring his ſenſe in evangelical termes, according to the intent and purpoſe of the Spirit therein: That therefore which the Prophet ſpeaks of the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh, is extended by the Apoſtle to a bleſſed effect that ſhall follow thereupon, which he might in reaſon warrantably do, for <hi>cauſâ proximâ poſitâ neceſſe eſt poni effectum,</hi> the effect will undoubtedly follow the cauſe, and that coming of the Meſſiah was certainly the immediate cauſe of all the happineſs that at any time was to come upon the Church to the end of the World. Here is then no contradiction in this diſparity, but a ſweet and melodious harmony rather, the eccho whereof to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion ſoundeth in this manner: This Redeemer or redeeming Kinſman of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, being come unto <hi>Sion,</hi> ſhall out of <hi>Sion,</hi> that is, from his Church, where he hath his dwelling and abode by his ſpirit, cauſe a deliverance to ariſe for his kindred <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring them again to their ſpiritual eſtate, which being loſt by their unbelief, he had purchaſed again for them: And becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer was to ſlay the murderer of his kindred, as well as to re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffe them in their Land and livelihood, therefore ſhall this deliverer alſo turn away, that is, utterly deſtroy ungodlineſs (their murderous enemy) out of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which being his act for them, they alſo by right of propinquity and nearneſs of kindred may be ſaid themſelves to be active in it.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter then, the Apoſtle by his variation of the Prophets termes ſeems to take away all ſcruples of the <hi>Jews</hi> Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Firſt, their Redeemer ſhall be their Deliverer, who is both willing and able ſo to be, willing by his relation unto them, able be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the Lord ſtrong and mighty. Secondly, he ſhall come out of <hi>Sion,</hi> becauſe he is come unto <hi>Sion,</hi> that is, he ſhall from his Church, by ſome powerful means that ſhall be uſed, iſſue out a deliverance unto them, becauſe he came to his Church to be her Redeemer. Thirdly, neither ſhall their ungodlineſs, that is, their pertinacy in
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:42108:197"/>their preſent infidelity hinder this deliverance (as ſome conceive by it an impoſſibility of their return) for he ſhall turn it away from them, and they ſhall no more turn unto it again.</p>
            <p>Secondly it is obſervable, Though the Apoſtle here varyeth from the Prophet in the formality of <hi>Iſraels</hi> converſion and deliverance, yet he fully agreeth with him in the ſubject thereof, that is, <hi>Jacob;</hi> For mark, Neither of them both ſaith, Ungodlineſs ſhall be turned away from <hi>Judah,</hi> which was the remnant that God had reſerved, to the end that they ſhould know that he was the Lord, Neither do they ſay, from <hi>Iſrael</hi> (as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Judah</hi>) which had been long ago driven into baniſhment; But <hi>from Jacob,</hi> as ſignifying all his poſterity, All I ſay, not intending probably every particular perſon that ſhould come out of his loyns, but as ranked into ſeveral Tribes, not one of them ſhall be loſt, but all ſhall be ſaved, that is, All of them in their ſeveral generations ſhall after this deliverance continue faithful with their God, and never be ſeparated from him any more.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the Apoſtle and Prophet both engage the truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, for the accompliſhment of this deliverance in theſe words, <hi>For this is my Covenant with them, when I ſhall take away their ſins:</hi> With them, that is, without all controverſie to be underſtood of the ſeed and poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> (as the whole current of the Apoſtles deſign in this Chapter makes it manifeſt) and as hath been before ſufficiently proved. I demand then, Hath God Covenanted with this his <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſave and deliver them from their ſinne and captivity, when the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is come in; and when the Word is gone out of his mouth, and paſt into a record in Holy Writ, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of his revealed Counſels to his Church, will he then retract it, and not keep his Covenant? O farre be it from any to put ſuch an imputation of inconſtancy upon the Unchangeable God: Faithful is he that hath Covenanted, who alſo will do it. And now let us joyn theſe two together, the Strength of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Redeemer, and the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their God, and who is he then that can doubt of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration?</p>

               </label> I anſwer, Should this be granted (which yet is too tenaciouſly held by the <hi>Lutheran</hi> party) it may well be demanded, What advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage would accrew to the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by the reception of the <hi>Jews?</hi> How ſhall the world be enriched (according to the word of the Apoſtle) by their fulneſs, more then it was by their fall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, if the world muſt be diſſolved immediately upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion? I will not deny but this may be the glorious and bleſſed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe of the mighty acts of God upon the I heater of this world, and that it is kept as a reſerve by the providence of heaven to crown Meſſiah's victories and his peoples glory: But that at the very firſt appearance thereof, when the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the riches of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſo largely promiſed in the Word, and ſo earneſtly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and deſired in ſundry generations, ſhall by the good hand of God be produced into act, that the I ſay, at the very riſe and ſpringing of theſe glorious manifeſtations of Gods Power and Faithfulneſs, this ſtage ſhould be taken down, and the ſcene removed into another world, as if the diſtinction between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there, as it is here, is not eaſily to be believed. Undoubtedly God will ſo do this marvellous act that it ſhall for ſome time be had here in remembrance to the advancement of his own glory, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his people, and to the everlaſting confuſion of the Prince of darkneſs with all his adherents.</p>
            <p>Neither is this conſidence without ſufficient warrant from the word of God; for beſides that which hath been already ſaid to this purpoſe, if we conſult the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> once again in the place before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and compare him with the Apoſtle in theſe very words, that we have ſtood laſt upon, we ſhall finde ground firm enough whereon to build this aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That this world ſhall continue for ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations after the <hi>Jews</hi> return from their finne and captivity.</p>
            <p>Obſerve therefore, When the Prophet had ſaid, <hi>The Redeemer ſhall come to</hi> Sion, <hi>and unto them that turn from tranſgreſsion in</hi> Jacob, he addeth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.21.</note> 
               <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, My Spirit is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord henceforth and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words I confeſs in the ſpirit of them, are directed to the Church, and the children of it, aſſuring them that Gods Spirit and Word ſhall continue with them for their inſtruction in all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:42108:198"/>for their ſalvation. But when the Apoſtle who with the Prophet is guided by the ſame infallible Spirit ſhall lead us further to an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them unto the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> after their Reſtauration, we may ſafely conclude that they do carry alſo with them this ſenſe as well as the former, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall, when they are returned unto the Lord, cleave unto him for ſome generations, three at leaſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſhall continue ſtedfaſt unto the end.</p>
            <p>Now that the Apoſtle intendeth the ſame with the Prophet in this particular as well as in any other before inſiſted upon, ſeemeth to me very probable. He doth not indeed interſert thoſe very words of the Prophet, having mentioned that already which was equivalent with them:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.</note> I or as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> will have the long-ſuffering of God to be accounted Salvation, ſo the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in that he ſaith, <hi>All</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> reckons the pouring out of Gods Spirit upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and putting his Word into their mouth, together with their conſtant adherency thereunto throughout their generations (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophecy written of them) to be Salvation alſo.</p>
            <p>This ſenſe I conceive doth the Contexture point out unto us, and I ſhall humbly commend it to the examination of the Church. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle when the finne of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is taken away, ſaith, as the Prophet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him had ſaid in the name of the Lord, <hi>This is my Covenant with them:</hi> What is that? Nothing more is added by the Apoſtle, and it might be thought that the ſubſequent words of the Prophet, wherein the Covenant is expreſſed, ſhould have been rehearſed by the Apoſtle, but they we ſee are omitted, not as if he did for brevities ſake cut them off, as it were with an <hi>Et caetera,</hi> as <hi>Junius</hi> would have it:<note place="margin">Parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Which being ſo, it will neceſſarily follow that their Converſion
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:42108:199"/>ſhall not be at the very inſtant of the final Conſummation, but long before it.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle goeth on, verſ. 28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſhew the certainty of the <hi>Jews</hi> Reſtauration, anticipating ſome objections that may be made againſt it. <hi>As concerning the Goſpel,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they are enemies for your ſakes, but as touching the election, they are beloved for the Fathers ſakes.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now that we may alſo interpret aright the Apoſtle in theſe words, let us examine a little what he means by theſe gifts and calling of God. Some underſtand here by (gifts) the ſaving graces of Gods ſpirit, whereby his people are adapted for his ſervice in all holy obedience to his commands; and this calling they take to be Gods effectual calling them to a ſtate of ſalvation; for ſay they, as for any other gifts and calling of God, they are many times revoked, which implies ſome kinde of repentance in God (as the Scripture ſpeaks often concerning him) as being ſorry at his heart that ever he had ſo beſtowed them: But of his ſaving graces and effectual calling he never repents. Thus I ſay do ſome render the ſence of this place: But though this be true
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:42108:199"/>
               <hi>in Theſi,</hi> I conceive it doth not fully ſquare with the Apoſtles mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for if theſe be the gifts and this the calling, we ſee clearly the <hi>Jews</hi> have been deprived of them long ago, and therefore are not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; neither can this Verſe be a confirmation of what the Apoſtle had ſpoken before concerning the Fathers.</p>
            <p>By theſe gifts therefore and calling, I take to be meant the liberal manifeſtations of divine bounty in outward things towards this people both fathers and children, and Gods ſeparating them from other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be his firſt-born. This is that election mentioned in the Verſe before going, upon which ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi> well, <hi>Eos olim Deus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legit, hoc eſt, ſummis beneficiis affecit,</hi> God choſe them, that is, God bleſſed them with great bleſſings above other people, <hi>Elegiſſe enim Deus dicitur quibus eximie benefecit,</hi> for God is ſaid to chuſe thoſe to whom he doth in an extraordinary manner extend his bounty, <hi>Et ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let id non ſiue magnâ cauſâ dici de Patribus Judaeorum,</hi> and that doth the Scripture very often not without good cauſe apply unto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, as appears, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.37. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.4.

            <p>One inſtance of Gods immutability towards them in this kind above all other people, let us here inſert, as being proper and pertinent to our purpoſe, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the very name and memorial of this people is not for their contumacy in their ſin utterly extinct in the world (which hath been the deſtiny of others, and they could

            <p>To make this evident, conſider, the Holy Scripture gives report of ſundry famous and mighty Nations that were of old contemporary with the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe height was like the height of the Cedars, and their ſtrength like unto that of Oakes, yet hath God deſtroyed their fruit from above,<note place="margin">

               </label> The Apoſtle gives an anſwer hereto likewiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 30.31. For as ye in times paſt have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:42108:201"/>through their unbelief, even ſo have theſe alſo now not believed, that through your mercy, they alſo may obtain mercy. Which words ſeem to be written by the Apoſtle in forme of a <hi>Prolepſis</hi> to preoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the aforeſaid objection by a clear demonſtration in themſelves that ſhould obtrude it, being as much as to ſay, Learn of your ſelves that the <hi>Jews</hi> Converſion is not altogether hopeleſs, notwithſtanding their preſent enmity againſt God in their diſobedience to his Goſpel; For if you who were ſometimes fooliſh and diſobedient, living in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and envy, even as bad as the <hi>Jews,</hi> hating of God, and hateful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, have yet nevertheleſs obtained mercy, why ſhould you doubt but that the <hi>Jews,</hi> though they be now a ſtubborn and refractory peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, may obtain mercy with God alſo? eſpecially ſeeing mercy hath happily come unto you upon the occaſion of their contumacy, but to them it ſhall come in a far more excellent way, <hi>viz.</hi> Through your mercy, that is, by beholding of that mercy which God hath manifeſted unto you.</p>
            <p>Gods aim and purpoſe, we ſee, is the exaltation of his mercy though men be mercileſs in judging and condemning one another, for ſaith the Apoſtle v. 32. God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. Where the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </label> I anſwer, Firſt the uncertainty of the time of every mans particular diſſolution may ſuffice to take away all ſuch carnal preſumption:For as I ſaid before alluding to that of the Pſalmiſt <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.2. <hi>Day unto day uttereth ſpeech,</hi> The day of death gives an infallible teſtimony to the day of judgement of every mans final eſtate, whether it be good or bad, whether it ſhall be to the reſurrection of life, or the reſurrection of damnation. And according to that information, ſo ſhall the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be, as death leaves us, ſo judgment ſhall finde us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We that are Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the manifold grace of God muſt not be afraid to make known the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God in Scripture, leaſt ungodly people ſhould make an ill uſe of it. What ever the conſequents be of our ſidelity in the diſcharge of our Miniſtery, we are to leave them to the wiſdom and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:42108:202"/>of the Almighty, who will order all things for his own glory, as ſeemeth good unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Even in this very caſe touching the end of the world the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> though he had in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> written of the ſudden and unexpected coming of the Lord yet when he perceived that ſome falſe teachers were like to take occaſion by what he had written thereof, to make thoſe people believe that the day of Chriſt was then at hand, thinking thereby, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, to carry on a pernicious deſign againſt the whole doctrine of the Goſpel, he thereupon tells them plainly in his ſecond Epiſtle,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.2.3.</note> that <hi>That day ſhould not come,</hi> before ſuch and ſuch things which he there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were firſt come to paſs: He feared not, it ſeems, leſt he ſhould give occaſion of a carnal ſecurity to preſumptuous ſinners (as it is here objected to us) by his writing of the protraction of the great day, but leaves that to their peril, who will pervert his words, and turn them to ſuch a ſiniſter ſenſe, declaring the minde of God clearly, without caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch ſcruples, as theſe Objectors have cauſleſly deviſed, to ſtop the current of this Doctrine. And this may be a ſufficient warrant unto us to ſpeak freely of that which the Scripture holds out unto us in this particular, not regarding what wicked perſons deluded by the devil may ſuggeſt unto themſelves thereby.</p>
            <p>And yet as <hi>Calvin</hi> well obſerveth upon the place, Neither doth this word of the Apoſtle about the deferring of the great day, contradict other Scriptures, which ſpeak of it as being at hand, <hi>Inſtat enim,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Dei respectu, apud quem mille anni ſunt tanquam dies unus:</hi> It is at hand in Gods account, with whom a thouſand years are but as one day, though to us it may ſeem long, being lengthened out for many generations, unto the time appointed of the Father, that ſo the great work of God in this world, decreed from Eternity, might be fully finiſhed.</p>
            <p>In fine, Whatſoever is or can be objected againſt this doctrine, we may ſafely conclude it to be of no force: But for it ſelf, it ſhall ſtand, and prove infallibly a victorious truth in the Church, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>Let all therefore that wiſh well unto <hi>Sion</hi> lay it cloſe to their hearts, that they may now more then ever, ſeeing the time approacheth, lay out their utmoſt ſtrength and zeal in the promoting thereof, praying
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42108:203"/>earneſtly, conſtantly unto God, that this ancient beloved people may once again finde grace in his ſight, caſting away thoſe ſins, which may probably be a hinderance to the bringing on of this glorious work. And amongſt them all, let us abandon the Idolatries and Superſtitions of the Romiſh Synagogue, which will certainly be a very great obſtacle to the <hi>Jews</hi> converſion (though God will alſo in his own time make this great mountain of oppoſition to become a plain.</p>
            <p>Thus I ſay ſhould this doctrine be promoted by us, and whatſoever elſe Divine Providence may put into our hands to do, in order to ſuch an excellent end, O let us do it with all our might. It is doubtleſs a moſt Catholike doctrine, as tending to an univerſal Union under Chriſt our Head, it is the moſt noble and Divine doctrine, next unto that of the great work of eternal Salvation wrought by Chriſt, that is revealed unto us in the Goſpel, and it is moſt advantageous to us <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> of all other Doctrines, therefore we ſhould promote it: It is that which openeth to the Church the bottomleſs and inexhauſtible trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Wiſdome and Knowledge of God, to look with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Apoſtle did, into the depth thereof. And though neither men nor Angels can be able of themſelves, in this or any elſe of the <hi>Arcana Coeli,</hi> the counſels of the moſt High, to know the minde of God, yet ſince as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>We have the minde of Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.</note> who is in the boſome of the Father, and hath declared him unto us, we may with confidence make our boaſt and ſpeak of that which he hath revealed. And becauſe God hath an abſolute Sovereignty over all his creatures, not bound unto them with any Popiſh or Pelagian thongs of Neceſſity, Congruity or Condignity, but is free to do what he pleaſe by the liberty of his own will, to caſt off the <hi>Jews,</hi> and receive the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their ſtead, and reſtore the <hi>Jews</hi> again to his grace and favour, that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> may together rejoyce in his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (For of him, and through him, and to him are all things.)
